11-12-2010|f|Hello All Nairalanders/Moderators,  Can we have Consumer Complaints Forum as a separate section on Nairaland please? I have a complaint about PHCN services and bills that I'm getting. I have been to Consumer Forum of Nigeria (CAFON) hosted by Sola Salako but PHCN personnel deliberately came very late to the forum in order to avoid consumer questions and they ran away before the end of the programme under the guise that they had more important appointments!!! I wonder what appointments could be more important than that of the customers paying their bills.  I know its almost the same experience with everyone living in 9ja and people hardly bother such issues anymore, but we the Nairalanders should be able to set up our own equivalent of United States Tea Party forum and begin to get the government to give attention to our objective complaints. Let us help ourselves.  My complaint is that I keep getting Meter Maintenance Charge as part of my bill every month. I have written to my local PHCN office to protest that I dont have a meter, even though I paid for one years back and have continued to give copies of my receipt to them. They just told me I have to keep paying as there's nothing they can do about it. I checked on line and was asked to write to the Power Minister to protest it but we know President Goodluck Jonathan is currently in charge of the power ministry. How do you get Mr. President to give attention to this sort of complaint? I wrote my first complaint letter three years ago when I was getting N154 meter maintenance charge as part of my monthly bill. This was increased to N1019 since July 2010 without consultation or warning whatsoever. I went to my local PHCN office and all I got was "it not just you but everyone is affected by the increase" attitude. Nobody seems to want to hear that I haven't got a meter talk less of getting it maintained by PHCN staff. Nobody does anything but drop the monthly bill at my door.  Nairalanders, the election is just round the corner and I feel that if nothing is done about this governmental rip-off, the private companies who buy off PHCN will continue this trend when they take over the business. Please let us make our voice heard by this government.  What is your experience and what result did you get if you did anything about it? Can anyone advice us how we can get this and other consumer issues to the attention of the government, whether local, state or federal? Thanks in advance for your useful contribution.  ps: Moderator, please feel free to copy this unto other sections in order to get good response. Thanks.

12-7-2014||Ireti123 checked in here!  This is probably the first thread on Nairaland.
25-3-2005|m|Hello,  The following guidelines have been created specifically for Nairaland, in addition to standard rules of forum etiquette. These are guidelines, and not rules.  1. Nairaland is an English language forum. English happens to be our official language in Nigeria. it also happens to be the language of the web. Please make every effort to use clear English at all times:[list]  [li]Avoid 'netspeak' or 'SMS-language'. 'You' is spelled Y-O-U, not u![/li]  [li]Avoid pidgin English, but [I]'put am inside italics'[/I] if you need to use pidgin English.[/li]  [li]Punctuate properly. This makes the forum easier to read. Capitalize your I's.[/li]  [li]We have a spell checker on the site. Use it![/li]  [li]No swear words. This one is a rule, not a guideline.[/li] [/list]  Try to make your posts very easy to read.  2. Avoid posting advertisements or running promotions or contests without the consent of the administrator. Just send me a private message and we'll iron out things! Don't attempt to use this forum to promote any commercial interests without the consent of the administrator!  [I]this list is under construction[/I]
11-4-2005|m|I think we should be allowed to use SMS language. It is more easier to type 'u' as 'you. And everybody understands it. Not everybody uses ten fingers to type.
11-4-2005|m|@diakim: Your point is worthy of serious consideration. I'm working with the assumption that posts are more often read than written. So, the cost of one person spending a little extra time making his post readable results results in a much greater benefit: hundreds of people who will find the post easier to read.  So I can't change this guideline unless I'm able to get a program to automatically translate SMS language to English! I've tried enabling automatic translation of some words, but it doesn't work very well in practice because of the complexity of English grammar.
11-4-2005||Seun, do you really know what a forum is? I'm sure you don't. A forum is not a newspaper where the editor has to go about editing and modifying each post to make it meet some outward standard. So the idea of you scrutinizing every post for grammatical errors and God knows what is damn silly and funny.  I wonder what you would do if you were the admin in charge of  Do you know how many thousands of stuff people post there per day? And in a forum one doesn't have to beg any body to approve the sort of words he uses. After all this is no job application and a member is at no obligation to post on the site.
11-4-2005|m|I imagine that Nairaland is a different kind of forum:  * Nairaland wants to be taken seriously. * Nairaland wants to be as readable as a newspaper. * Nairaland wants people to take time to compose their thoughts. * Nairaland favors the sort of language that anybody can understand. * People using the Internet for the first time should feel at home here. * Nairaland wants to be clean enough for even the President to participate.  So welcome to the Nairaland World! People who come here are not here because they want "a forum". They are here because they want to share ideas/knowledge with many other Nigerians. I believe that we need to project a certain kind of image to get there.  Update: What is the point of posting anywhere if nobody's going to read it? Update 2: Feel free to use 'sms language'/netspeak if you're posting from a mobile phone.
11-4-2005|f|Touch
19-4-2005|m|well, I can see the idea admin is trying to bring in.  THEREFORE there should be a part of this forum that accommodates all the s**t we don't want Mr president to see.  [I]Plzz abeg[/I], have you forgotten that this forum is also via WAP and as such. People will post from their phones. There's no keyboard on my phone so I'm limited to SMS language and some other s**t
19-4-2005|m|Mamba, I never thought of the WAP issue. Thanks!  This forum is very young and insightful comments like yours are very much appreciated. I'm going to temporarily ammend the rules to accomodate people browsing from their mobile phones. The long term solution will be to have a filter than transparently converts 'sms language' to English.  From now on, members are permitted to use 'SMS language' if posting from a mobile phone.
19-4-2005|m|thanks admin, long live NAIRALAND  still the best
29-4-2005|m|Thanks. Now tell your friends!

25-3-2005|m|I love the KUSH band. Their vocal skills are incredible!  Their website - kushsound.com - no longer works (it's been lost to domain name squatters). Does anyone know what they're doing now?  Has the band been disbanded?
01-4-2005|f|Is it the Kush trio of Lara, Amen and one other name I can't remember now? Nigerian Gospel artiste? If yes, I kinda love their music too. They are very good and, now that you've mentioned it, I haven't heard anything about them in a while. Hope they do not have problems singing as a group, because most Nigerian's group artistes I know are seperated: you know, members going solo. Examples are the Remedies, Plantashun boyz, etc.
02-4-2005|f|Since the last member got married, i think they have not been able to get together again. Lara does some kind of drawing and painting so i guess they are all busy with other things
02-4-2005|m|Hello delarontus,  Welcome to Nairaland! Please, tell us everything you know about the Kush band members. I'm dying to find out what happened to them. How do you know Lara does drawing? Do you have her website, weblog, or anything like that?  Seun
02-4-2005|f|Seun, is this another mobile nigeria forum. Anyway watched an interview on the Kush members and she revealed that. She also said she was planning an exhibition. Emem is a lawyer don't know if she practises. The last one, can't remember her name now is Mrs. George. Finito!
13-4-2005||nope you're wrong. they have been able to get together again...but not completely. the other two still perform at shows. recently they were at the AM express anniversary and i think at another artist-exhibition show in Abuja. note that one of them mother works with the NTA, so u know why they get good publicity on NTA.
14-4-2005|f|I am aware of that but i mean together completely as we all know them.
14-4-2005|m|What is the name of the one that works in NTA?
15-4-2005||as i said before: ...but not completely. the other two still perform at shows. meaning they are no more a complete thrio or is it quartet. they are just two now. but it ain't all bad, after all Boyz II men have been reduced to a thrio now, and they're still slamming.  i didn't say one of them works at NTA, i said one of them has a mother who works at NTA
15-4-2005|f|@Seun, Emem's mother works at NTA.
19-7-2005|f|Was just sitting here wondering about Kush, decided to google them as I do now and then, and found this forum.  I used to host a couple of radio programs on Rhythm 93.7 in Lagos / 94.7 Abuja (Rhythm & Soul and Gospel Vybes), and had the pleasure of interviewing the Kush members. We'd been in HOTR together for a while, but their manager - TY (Toyin)'s brother wanted to make sure their publicity was well planned, and so I had to wait a while to get them on my show. I know they were to release an album about when I left Naija, but never got my hands on a copy. I did and do have promotional samples of some of the songs - including the one with Sounds of Blackness - but I'm almost sure they must have remixed it a bit more before releasing it. Now that this thread has sent me down memory lane, I think maybe I should see if old email accounts are still active. Maybe I'll come back and post any new info I can get. It's been a while, though...Emem was just starting Law school when I left, Dapo was in the states working with the likes of George Benson... I really want to know what happened. More than that, I want to know that they are all happy and fulfilled in whatever they are doing...  PK
05-1-2006||Hi every1 this is Meny...I'm Emems Brother...Kush still Exists but without...Toyin...They are trying to come up with a Bang...but you all have to be patient...I might come up with a bang too...who knows...lets just keep our fingers crossed...my website is... www.betarecords.com/meny.ema check out my site...Lara may be married and into her architecture but Kush is STILL alive...and I will make sure that stays that way...
26-3-2006|m|Wow, Emma, pleased to meet you! How can we attend Kush music concerts?
26-3-2006|m|Hey man keep it up. you are cool and all of us here are with you. Tell us when your [album] will be out. Peace!
26-3-2006|m|hey meny wazzup man,  just wondering why the coincidence - you joining the forum just when the subject Kush is been discussed.  Hope there was no advertisement, whatsoever,  just wondering, nothing special!!!
26-3-2006|m|Once again, for Me Nairaland has made The link, I know we are talking of KUSH! That Great and wonderful Trio, But, .@ RHYTHMSOUL., I can say with out a doubt that You are PAULA.!!, I am a Fan, one really Big fan, I still send U mails once in a while too. Gospel Vybes, My oh My!!! i remember those sunday Mornings, i almost run late for church just cuz i always want to stay till 10am, enjoy the entire show and then get the Quiz questions for the week, and it did pay off one day, cuz i did win, ( The Book, Bad Girls Of the Bible and the CD by Lamer campbell), For me Radio was a bit diffrent when u left Rhythm93.7, especially sunday mornings, But Thank God For, BeBe Winans Radio Show, Now.  Hope its all Good for with YOU!, out there, Here is wishing U all the best, Good and God speed in all u do
27-3-2006|m|I've always liked Kuch too (much to the chagrin of my flatmates at school). My sister was given their cd- The Experience as a birthday gift but I've listened to it a lot more times than she has. Well like somone said, it looks like groups have a timeframe to exist. There are quite a number of them who are no more today. In this case, they were together in school (solid rock) which is how and where they started music. But you know they graduate, start their careers, marry and relocate and its not so easy anymore. I think we shgould make do with what we have- their only release so far and wait till sometime in future when they'll get together to do another album. cheers.
04-4-2006||that is true where is kush, well there music is cool i really mis them
04-5-2006|m|Hi, to all fellow Kush lovers, this link will be an interesting read-   Cheers
04-5-2006|m|KUSH star wins British Councils music entrepreneur award  Emem-Abasi Ema, former member of the music group KUSH has emerged as the Nigerian winner of the British Councils International Young Music Entrepreneur (IYMEY) of the Year award 2006. Emem, 27, is a law graduate of the University of Lagos and was songwriter and artiste with KUSH. She is now the Executive Director of VZHUNMEDIA Entertainment Ltd and One Management Services. Her organisation promotes Nigerian culture through music and entertainment and discovers and nurtures young talents.  Reacting to the announcement, Emem said: I am overly excited at getting this opportunity to represent Nigeria and also be a crusader for the promotion and development of the Nigerian music industry. Right now its still very surreal. I am looking forward to working with the British Council and the panel of judges. These (panel) are people who are well respected in the industry and Ive looked up to them over the years  The IYMEY award attracted 172 applications from across Nigeria from young people (25-35 years of age) working in different areas of music enterprise ranging from music promotion and production to artiste management and music journalism. Emem was one of the nine finalists for the award who made presentations to and were interviewed by a panel of seasoned music industry practitioners.  The panel of judges involved in final shortlisting and interviewing was made up of Keni Ogungbe, CEO of Kennis Music, music mogul and broadcaster; Edi Lawani from Showbiz Network Services, music promoter and events manager; Carl Raccah, CEO of Nation Africa record label; Olisa Adibuah of Cool FM/Storm Productions and currently working on Big Brother Nigeria; Tunde Kuboye from Jazz 38, veteran jazz artist and promoter; Onyeka Onwenu, recording artist and NTA Board Member among many other things; and Denise Waddingham, Assistant Director British Council Lagos and British Council Nigerias Head of Arts.  The judges were on the look out for the candidate with the most outstanding entrepreneurial ability, a proven track record within the Nigerian music industry as well as leadership potential, vision and good presentation skills. As the winner for Nigeria, Emem will contend with nine others from countries such as Morocco, Poland and Venezuela for the global IYMEY award. She will also participate in a 10-day tour of the UK music industry, comprising visits, meetings, seminars and live concerts and events in June 2006.  She will have the opportunity to meet key leaders, institutions, companies, etc. within the music sector. Final selection of the worldwide winner will be through a presentation and interview session with an elite panel of UK music industry professionals.  The British Council established the award  International Young Music Entrepreneur of the Year (IYMEY)  to champion and celebrate the importance of creative entrepreneurs working in the field of music. The award is being promoted through the British Councils international network of offices. It is focussed on countries from transitional and developing economies and will showcase individual achievement and potential.  In 2005, Nigerias Lanre Lawal emerged the global winner for the design equivalent, the International Young Design Entrepreneur of the Year (IYDEY).
04-5-2006|m|I'm their FAN
26-5-2006||[b][/b]kush ?? who are they
09-2-2007|m|Toyin is married, she is now Toyin Bello, she's a pretty good photographer and making waves in that circuit, Lara also got married and she's now Lara George, she works with an I.T. firm in Lekki (Socket Works), but she's planning to drop an album pretty soon probably sometime before the year runs out, she has a single on air presently (according to her), but I haven't heard it yet and Emem according to Seun's post, is Executive Director of VZHUNMEDIA Entertainment Ltd . Finally, Dapo is a producer in the U.S, he's kinda different now, grown dreads and all, has his own production outfit and also intends to drop an album soon.
09-2-2007|m|I loved them as a group, anyway. I think they were greater than the sum of their parts. Almost perfect!
22-2-2007|m|Here's Lara's picture on the West African Idol Page:
26-2-2007|m|Hi Nairaland.  As regards Lara's single, is it the 'Ijoba Orun' track that has been on Cool FM for the last couple of weeks? Does anyone know where I can buy a copy?  To think I actually searched the covers of every single Nigerian CD in Nu Metro (the Palms and Silverbird Galleria), looking for any CD that had a track title similar to 'Ijoba Orun' or 'Mu mi dele'. I should have done the internet search first!  Really, looking forward to recieving feedback on this, and having fun on Nairaland
29-3-2007||na wa oh
24-6-2007|m|R dey still 2geda?
10-10-2007|m|m sure all those kush fans know that toyin's album has been released. She's now TY Bello.
11-10-2007|m|Howz her album?
11-10-2007|m|havent heard the whole album, but her singles and video is rocking airwaves
14-1-2009|m|I know Kush very well as I worked closely with them during their release of "The Experience" Is anybody still interested in this post? Emem, now named Mem' O is on the verge of releasing a new single.
25-3-2005|m|I have read Harry Potter books 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. it is supposed to be a children's book, but it talks about death and witchcraft, and for some reason children are reading it!  Some people believe it encourages witchcraft, and should be avoided for religious reasons. What's your opinion?
26-3-2005|f|Well, let's just say I've got a friend who would never buy Harry Potter products for her kids, not even the pencil case. If I had kids (which I dont just yet), I wouldn't either. Even if it is not aimed at promoting witchcraft or whatever else they contain, I don't suppose I need my kids, or anyone else's for that matter, attempting to practice or dwelling upon the contents of Harry Porter products (esp. books and films). Let's not forget that these are the formative and crucially impressionable years of these children. It is very important what they read, watch and listen to. This is why you meet some of their kids (white) saying they want to go into the University to study witchcraft and black powers. How incredible!!!. So, ahm.. , yes, where were we ? My opinion....... it might teach morally upright lessons, it might not intend to promote witchcraft but Harry Porter does not seem appropriate for kids, if you ask me. Ra
27-3-2005|m|It's not just about the lessons in Harry Potter (that sometimes life can be unpleasant and you have to fight 'evil').  It's about the fact that millions of children are [I]willingly[/I] reading several long novels telling one story, and they are not asking for pretty pictures. That's what's so unique about Harry Potter: children are reading willingly!
30-3-2005|m|Harry Potter's books and movies have been known to have strong witchcraft and occult contents. With this in mind, it will be foolish letting kids have access to these materials, otherwise they will be initiated into witchcraft or might grow up with a warped or deformed forms of thinking.  Beware please, as witchcraft is a highly dangerous practice in this part of the world. A witch in a family (either young or old) can spell a lot of disaster and nightmares. They bring no good to their family.  It is my strong opinion that under no circumstances should children have access to any of Harry Potter's materials.
30-3-2005|f|In as much as i dont believe in witchcraft, if i want my children to enyoy some educational fiction story books, i think i will prefer the fairy tale stories like Cinderella and the likes. I think Harry Potter should be for the matured mind.
04-4-2005|m|i have read bks 1-4 and quite a number of other books that make Harry potter seem pale in comparison, however i would say that such books would not catch childrens' fancy the way Harry Potter does. I think the reason why there's so much of an outcry against it is 'cos its so popular however I agree that it is not suitable for children which might seem unfortunate since i guess the book seems particularly geared towards them. Does it encourage witchcraft? i don't know but i think kids below a certain age shld not be allowed to read such books. (Seun u say u've 1-5, correct me if i'm wrong but i think the films might actually be worse than the books )
04-4-2005|m|I have read the books 1 to 5. In my opinion, the films are tamer than the books, because a faithful movie rendition of 'Harry Potter' would be:[list] [li]Far too long[/li] [li]Rated 18![/li] [/list]
05-4-2005|f|Your question reads Does Harry Potter encourage witchcraft? It sure does, whether book or movie. I have watched two of the movies and read the book too. I found it interesting i must say, but then for the younger minds, it aint too good.
05-4-2005|m|I think the reason many people in the West aren't concerned about whether it encourages witchcraft or not is because they don't believe in witchcraft in the first place.
05-4-2005|f|well i do not hink tht harry porter encourages witchcraft. for crying out loud we r in d 21 century. and i do not believe in tht. i think tht it is a good movie tht encourages kids to be free wif their imagination. it encourages them to explore and to think 3 dimensionally but it definately does not encourage witchcraft. if parents do not feel good bout tht, at leats they could watch the movir with the kids and just explain stuff to them bout the movie if tht would make them feel better.  kids are allowed to watch cartoons, but they r violent. cartoon characters are often shot at ( thought they never die) and kid get the impression tht if some one is shot at tht tht is ok. i mean tht is just not reality!! there are also cartoon characters tht strap them,selves wif explosives. so if it is ok for them to watch those then it is equally ok for them to watch harry porter.  i think tht tht is one great movie. althought i did not get to watch all three of them but i did enjoy them and i think tht it is a good entertainment for kids.  dis is all my opnion. feel free to rebuke.
15-4-2005|m|if you say that, then what would you say about Lord of the Rings? Kids also watch that, don't they? Though I agree that Harry Potter has strong occult undertones.
16-4-2005|f|Hey, it definitely does! I've read 1-4 (yet to read the 5th) though I don't dwell on them. It's just that I really love reading books. Please don't allow your kids read the book. I have cousins who really dwell on it and they go to the xtent of placing curses on me! How horrible please desist!
18-4-2005|m|Yoruba people (I'm 100% yoruba by the way) place 'curses' on each other all the time in normal conversation. "Your life will not be good", "God will punish you", "You're calling me crazy? Your children will be crazy". Is that witchcraft?  I don't think it is difficult for an 8 year old child to figure out that the magic in Harry Potter is not real. As a good parent, your children will ask you if they are not sure. And even if they they try the 'spells' like your cousins, will the spells work? If the spells don't work, then where is the harm?
22-4-2005||I love the books and films. There is so much fun and plenty to laugh about. there is the nice ol" good wins over evil endings. I believe the occultic and witchcraft opinions stems from the fact that we have a success and a bestseller here. I am a good Christian to be modest. Kids that turn out better in their classes always have better imagination through materials that they read. Lets stop fooling around too much... kids know better!. they know more about sex than you knew when you crossed over to adolescence. they watch films that you may not have seen. the concept is to teach a child in the way to go and when he grows he will not leave from it. harry potter wont enable him/her to become a witch neither will it let the kid fly. locking him up or not exposing him to information doesnt qualify as teaching in my opinion. Ofcourse, there are limits. certainly all things in life comes with limits even food does... but dont give me that witch escuse for a kid not to enjoy a well written story!.
28-5-2005|m|though its purely religious fiction, i doubt if it would be "healthy" for the new genaration of kids to watch or read. though if i had a kid( goddamn it i'm just 16), i wouldnt allow that, if my kid is kind of "adventuruous". a book like harry potter would give him wierd idea's.
07-6-2005|m|Men people never change, Harry Potter imparts good morals and that is what you are depriving your kids of if you stop them watching it.  I quoted the above becuase he mentioned Cinderella, we all tend to think that the things we grew up with as a kid were better but really they were not at all!  Cinderella is a story that is full of magic or I dey lie?  Red Riding Hood had a wolf that eat people!  But those are okay abi? Because we grew up with them?  Harry potter is for the next generation and I will happily let my kids read them.  Even when as kinds we all watched the cartoon shows that had high levels of violence and such, please you people should have a reality check and realise that we all watched such stuff when growing up and it did not harm as long as they had a good moral theme.
07-6-2005|m|I feel you Viera, Most of the repondents probably grew up reading all the ladybird series. What are fairies and what do they practice if not magic.. I wonder why you wont let your kid watch harry potter but let them watch Disney cartoons Aladdin was all about Magic and genies, Beauty and the Beast is about magic, so was Little Mermaid and any Disney you care to name. The only one that comes to mind without Magic is Tarzan, even Mulan had families talking to there dead ancestors (necromancy). Yet I dont hear anyone complaining about disney.. Heck Shakespear had aa lot of magic and spells and yet you odnt complain about that one? Go read the Tempest again and tell me if Prospero wasnt a wizard with a demon at his service.. Or what did Puck the fairy do in a Midsummer Nightsdream?  I don tire jare...
07-6-2005|m|I agree with the last 2 posters. How will kids perform witchcraft by watching or reading books ? Sleeping Beauty-- Slept for 100yrs under the spell of magic Sesame street-- Count Dracula was mesmerizing kids with magic. Jack and the beanstalk- Magic beans. Pot of Life ( Nigerian TV series)- Full of spells.  Some won't let their kids read Harry Porter but will let them watch most of the Disney cartoons. Double standards i say.  I think we should be more open minded about certain things in life.
07-6-2005|f|i cant agree less with u guys... ther's nothing that bad in harry porter series my children wont watch...... i see nothing absolutely wrong in the film.... all the witchcrafts u guys re complaining about ain't gonna have adverse effects on children except for those who are evil from birth (may we not have those ones as our children :amen) a good kid will want to be like harry & his friends not like malfoy, sirus black e.t.c.
10-6-2005|f|ok can anyone here tell me how you know when witchcraft is real?
10-6-2005|m|
12-6-2005|f|Sure mate, let me know when you're free. I'll take you to my village.
12-6-2005|m|There is an offer of 1 million pounds to anyone who can prove the existence of magic, telepathy or supernatural.  No one has won it yet!
14-6-2005|m|Sure mate, let me know when you're free. I'll take you to my village.  Ra, you are not doing well for tourism development in your village, are you?  It's ok to be sophisticated and all that. We have to be careful of situations as they really don't come in such clear cut images. Pray for discernment and revelations. We need God to know what to do in situations like this.
21-6-2005|m|It's fiction... But you have to be careful with what you feed kids with at a young age.
24-8-2005|f|yes he does. I hate harry potter.
26-8-2005|f|i think seun should have a "i don't know" in the poll section because i don't know.
18-10-2005|f|Can someone still answer this please!
23-10-2005||yep, and we should not allow our kids to watch most television shows - any sexual relationships between adults is fake and does not describe the real complexities of life. Also, kids should not watch any disney movies or fairy tales - those too are fake and could initiate our children into witchcraft. And our kids should not atch cartoons - too much violence between those power rangers or captain planet - they may grow to think they should use their physical might against others. No more video games for children, they should learn that everyone has a good chance of succeeding in life. We should not allow our kids to hear "success" stories - these present an inaccurate picture of life and make kids think that if they work hard they will succeed - plenty of people work hard with very limited success.
26-10-2005|f|Harry Potter does encourage withcraft! These books are teaching children to cast spells and vexes on others as well as to have them to be changed into other images. I remember not too long ago how when a Harry Potter book was being released children where sleeping in front of books stores to get the book. That is idolzing! We need to teach our children the truth so they can be set free.
26-10-2005||Yeah! I agree, so do ALL Disney movies, ALL fairy tales, MOST children's stories. Additionally, MOST television stories promote sinful behavior - kissing your boyfriend or girlfriend, having sexual thoughts, magical beings - idolatry and witchcraft.  The best thing for our kids is to keep them locked up in the house where they will see, hear, and speak no evil and the only time we allow them to leave are the times we shuttle them to church. Further, we must be careful in church so they are not influenced by the materialism of the world, pastors in their Jeeps while other people suffer, the clothing people wear - heck We should keep kids from church, there are lots of unGodly activity there too  SO, yeah, the best thing is to just keep them locked up in the house. Yeah. . .I think that will do.  I mean, its not like parents are smart enough to teach children not to take something literally. Look at the number of kids who believe in Santa. Parents are useless. They let videogames, movies, books, other people, tv, and the rest of the world control their kids. Its really NOT the parents fault when a child does some things. I mean, no responsibility for educating children should be placed on the parents! Parents should have to speak once, and the children OBEY. That is what it says in the bible.
25-3-2005|m|People hold very strong, contradictory opinions on the performance of our current president, retired general Olusegun Obasanjo. What do you think? Does he deserve a pass mark, at least? Do you think there are people who would do better? I've opened a poll; let's settle this with a vote!
29-3-2005|f|well i would not say tht the pres has done a good job. he did promise a lot of things but i hardly saw anything being done!!. it is not only saying but it is d doing tht counts. so no i will say tht he did and has not done a good job for someone tht has been in power for tht long.
30-3-2005|m|I give him (Obasanjo) only 20%. Nothing more. He would have scored lower if not for the telecommunication sector that he successfully tackled. For other sectors of the economy, all I hear are fine speeches and no buttressing action.
02-4-2005|m|I think he's done pretty well. He's the first Nigerian president I actually enjoy listening to! THe only other political figure that doesn't put me to sleep if former president Bill Clinton of the US, so you can imagine how highly I rate Rtd. General Obasanjo!
04-4-2005|m|I would rather not vote - I don't know what to say of him. However I can't help wondering if he is even interested inthe welfare of NIgeria at all - I believe he's done more for Africa than for Nigeria. Whenever there's a crisis in an African country, you'll see him actively involved, while he doesn't seem to care about what's going on here.
04-4-2005|m|Another thing we must note: he is an elderly man. As people grow older they start thinking thoughts like "what legacy will I leave behind" or "what will future generations think about me". In terms of having money, he is making enough for himself and his family.  So I think his efforts are pretty sincere, and as a smart man they willl be pretty effective.
04-4-2005|m|[color=Blue][/color] As far as am concerned, Chief Olusegun Obasanjo has done pretty good, especially during his second tenure. Corruption as eaten deep in our policians. He is the firt President of this country that would sack a serving minister on basis/allegation of corruption. To me I scored him high.
05-4-2005||Iwill give the president 45%, 25% for his recent action against bribery and corruption and 20% for making GSM operation a reality. All the same, the poverty level have increased instead of reducing in the face of this oil boom we are experiencing under his regime.
05-4-2005|f|Ok, so he is an old man an he is thinking of what legacy he ought to leave behind! Screw that! If he has decided to take up a responsibility, he ought to live up to the expectations. I think it is all bull when people try to make excuses for someone. Whether he is old or not, he knew what challenges he would face and he knew what would be expected of him when he decided to run for president. I mean, even if he is old, he could delegate the work to younger officers.  Anyhow, I still do not feel that he did what was worth the term he was put in power. I mean it is not so difficult to run a country. I mean of course there are financial and racial issues, but please do not tell me that Nigeria is poor!. Hell no, she is swiming in wealth! It is just that there is too much corruption and greed for people to let the country grow. They all want successs for themselves; they do not know that it is in the country growing together that you even benefit more. Just once you have got the right formular to go bout it.  I mean, yeah, there are lots of obstacles but if he really wanted to do some thing, he could have made progress. but that all depends on what his main agenda for running for president was for in the first place. If you take up a responsibility, live up to it else.
06-4-2005|m|Chigsy,  I think you misunderstood my point. My point is that, as an older person, he is more likely to be sincere than a younger person!  Seun Osewa
13-4-2005|f|My rating for OBJ's performance/achievements as a president are way above average. Like most people, my arguments against his government were the lack of relief measures for the common man. The fact that there are no exceptional physical evidences or evident improvement to basic and social amenities were also included on my list of points against him and his administration. It took me a while and endless discussions with fellow politically passionate Nigerians to realise that my line of thought was somewhat parochial. That it is one thing to have good intentions and another for your fellow leaders and followers to see your vision and run with it alongside you. Our leadership is full of sabotagers (if there is any such word). We all know our country and the kind of people in power, the same vicious cycle that has been in leadership for ever. Power corrupts, they say, absolute power corrupts absolutely. The people in power stand to gain much less than they currently do in terms of material, stupendous material wealth and power/authority were the country to be better than this and favourable policies implemented.  To cut my tirade short, yes, OBJ is indeed contributing brilliantly (all the more applaudable are his efforts to achieve this even in the Unclad face of diverse oppositions and antagonism, some known to the public but the majority behind and within the corridors of power) to re-build this nation or at the very least to lay a better foundation on which the next generation can erect a great and admirable structure. Whether or not the said next generation or the so-called leaders of tomorrow are up to the daunting task remains to be seen.
15-4-2005|f|I don't think I want to rate him. He's done one good thing in the area of telecommunications, fine! He's also currently fighting corruption, good!  If you ask me, he is more of an "airborn" president! Just like Blackweaver said, he's gone about more for Africa than for his own beloved country.
16-4-2005|m|Ibrahim privately wrote:[list] [li]"Our president, Retired. General Olusegun Obasanjo is working assiduously through the fighting of corruption in our country.

17-4-2005|f|We have to bear in mind that the decadence and corruption plus sabotage in our system have eaten so deep into government and leadership. It will take years of thorough scrubbing to clean the debris and erase the marks, if ever. Now for one man to attempt to start that process is fantastic, in my opinion. The journey of a million years starts with the very first step, which is what I strongly believe OBJ is taking, the first few steps. I throw my weight behind him, for all it's worth.
09-5-2005|m|I disagree with those who are hailing Uncle Sege for his anti-corruption bid because, I believe he is not sincere. even if he is, then he is one-sided.  Afterall, there are people who have taken more than N55 million. Like Obasanjo who acquired hectares of lands, all in the name of 'Land Use Decree', and people like Abdulsalam, who became a Trillionaire in just about 10 months. And IBB, and so many others. Even the only known criminal who Uncle hides and helps in committing atrocities.
05-11-2005|m|Very Poor...I must say.  It must be given to him that he has allowed the few women (particularly the igbo women) to bring out their best which is what has brought the few areas of success that can be attributed to him.  On 'every' other front he has been a failure.
07-11-2005|m|Well I am not in Nigeria to be able to see the thing that this guy has done, But I must commend him for the telecoms and war against corruption. He is the only president that has ever tackle this issue. so in my pool he rate more than average
08-11-2005|m|With OBJ's committment, Nigeria is getting rid of the daggers of debt. Although inflation is high, other macro economics seem to be going in the right direction. I expect that there will be real economic growth next year.
29-9-2006|f|For even daring to touch the untouchables and fight corruption in nigeria, I give him 65%. This singular legacy is enough to make me vote him as the best nigerian president in recent years. Things have never been so good in our country in terms of fighting corruption. Unfortunatly, a few who have benefitted from the corrupt system of the past are crying foul. But we alongside Obj shall win this one in Jesus' name!!!
29-9-2006|m|OBJ has some good scores: To start, he liberalised the telecoms sector which brought GSM. He also ensured that fuel scarcity became a thing of the past. The minimum wage and improving workers salaries and then the anti corruption war. Also, he worked had to settle the paris club and put our external reserve to a fair figure. For these, I score him 30%. He has also been able to get Nigeria out of the record as being the most corrupt country to something better. His reforms are in line with the IMF/World Bank. He and his economic team got the banks recapitalised. NAFDAC is doing a fine job and fake drugs are losing ground.  OBJ has some bad scores: His reforms are aimed at selling up public corporations to the private sector so that private people can run it, the truth is that OBJ and his co-horts are gradually buying up Nigeria. He increased the pump price of fuel 5 times from N11 of Abacha days causing unbearable inflation to us all. He has refused to fix or build a new refinery because private investors would not buy and sell at the present prices thus making us import refined fuel. He ordered the killing of an entire community because of youth restiveness in that land. He has no respect for the courts and his corruption campaign is selective meaning it is unjust. He keeps retrenching railway workers and wants to scrap the pension system. He made sure the NLC got crippled by manipulating the N.Assy to pass the labour law which baned strike. Overall, the economy is in shambles as 60% of the pple live on less than $5 per day. All our systems have become decorative (postal, transport-no rail, education-decaying). He put a lot of money into NEPA and till today, electricity supply in Lagos is less than 30% of a full day and some days with total black out. The list of his mismanagement is exhaustive. He also loves to fly. He spent 1095 days of the first 1460 days abroad. He is also a bad politician. Audu Ogbeh wrote him a letter which was very touching and immediately he axed his party chairman only to become their life leader. He also does not like or tolerate dissent or free press. He ordered the shutdown of AIT. Had 2 journalist arested for a law which is inexistent in Nairaland. OBJ also ceded our God given Bakasi peninsula and other lands to common Cameroun.  On the bad areas, he scores a whooping 95%.  He is also very corrupt: He owns majority shares in transcorp. He did not declare his assets before becoming president in 1999 and awarded several frivolous contracts during the COJA events, Many Nigerians believe he is fighting corruption and have forgotten he has not been able to probe IBB. Anyway Crocodiles do not eat crocodiles.  Overall we were better than when he met us on the scale that we pay more for everything now than we used to before he got on board. We used to win football events as well but now, we only lose to Angola and not go to the world cup.
01-10-2006|m|To me OBJ didnt bring the GSM from what I know but executed it, anyway he tried in that area. The only thing OBJ did or has is He has best cabinet ever, a cabinte that has not done much becuase of his interests. Look at the following, we fought military over education privatization he does it freely noone challenged him, Health too bad, Roads terrible, Security worse ever, Food- you wont believe people die of hunger, Economy dwindling, Most corrupt regime ever, Disregard for rule of law, Unemployment worse, Transportation zero, Aviation highest number of plane crashes ever in d history of Nigeria, I dont know of any basis we will credit him, only on EFCC which has done a good work, thats d only if only the Commission will follow due process, I know soon he will regret ever establishing EFCC becuase he will go back to where he bleongs thats Bauchi Prision. No aplogies pls.
01-10-2006|m|40%
01-10-2006||well what i want to say now is the truth nothing but the truth,who do you think can perform better among all the contestant who are spearing the post :PERSIDENTin 2007,i can't see any one.am not saying Obasanjo is the best president that we ever produce,no but the PEOPLE WITH GOOD INTENTION ARE NOT COMING OUT.the obsion on the table is that we should please vote wisely in 2007.Mr Pres has really tried but he can do better. see internationally this guy has redeem our image ,but the issue of corruption can be eradicated totally if Mr Pres will allwed the medial 2 do their work.let us be praying for Nigeria concerning 2007 He is not saint but he needs prayer so that he will not do like Babagida-Abiola.SO THE RIGTH PERSON WILL BE OUR PRESIDENT COME 07 we need to pray for nigeria before 2007 ELECTION!!!!!!!!!

25-3-2005|f|Oh well, I agree that the family relationship is absolutely important. But I think that both husband and wife should manage the family, not only the man.  Oh well, traditionally, the husband ought to be the head of the family because the women did not work. But now, that belief is changing: women work too and they contribute equally in the running of the family. So I think the right thing is for both of them to manage the family. There ought to be understanding, and that is achieved if they both work together.
29-3-2005|f|Ok, first of all, you are entitled to your own opinion.  But I mean naturally men are the head of the family, but lately that structure is changing. A woman does not necessary have to depend on a man in order to live and neither does a man have to depend on a woman. Both of them are the provider of their home.  I mean people think that house keeping is not a job, but it is a full time job! I mean it will really be cool if we could get a man to exchange with a woman just for a day or two, and then they would let us know what they thought about it. Women that stay at home have a full time job and they even tend to work longer hours than the men do. So they are equally entittled to raise the kids together and hold the family together with the husband.
09-4-2005|m|(Emphasis mine)  Instructions to be obeyed! Come on, this is the 21st century. Where have you been for the past 200 years?  Now I truly understand the meaning of the word 'hilarious'! So please register asap and let's counsel you!
09-4-2005|f|Gone are the days when men shouted out instructions and women jump to do their bid. These days, men simply add the word 'sweetie' and women still run to carry out their wishes. Let's face it really, it's a man's world. Yes, women are helping out in the finances of the house now more than ever, but that by no means diminishes the mans authority.  In an ideal marriage however, the husband does not laud his authority over the wife. If there is mutual respect, I should think both parties are well aware of their duties and carry them out as at when due. What women are to men are helpers. If men are without us they become almost clueless. We both (the two sexes) cannot do without the other.  As the head of the house, the man is enamoured with huge responsibilities such as security for his family, financial provision and he is also the voice of wisdom most of the time. Nothing diminishes a man's respect faster than constantly shacking his responsibilities as the head of the family. If the head of the house remains faithful to these duties, there is absolutely no question of the wife's and indeed the children's respect for him.  In a nutshell, each party has a vital role to play in the family. Close knitted families are more often than not bound by love, respect and credibility. I speak very largely from experience, to the glory of God.
11-4-2005|m|Well, I'm glad that I get to be the head of the family by default. Isn't that wonderful? I don't even have to contest for the position!
17-4-2005|f|While not having to contest for the position, men however MUST maintain the position. Now that is a lifetime job. So, why make you contest for it when you spend your life defending it?
17-4-2005|m|Well when I said that the man has the resposibility to manage the family, I did not means the man should be issueing out instructions without the agreement of both parties, that the man and the wife. the man always has the last say in any matter in the house, he will listen to every one idea before giving out the last order. No wife or woman with respect can issue instructions to the husband and believe me if any which means there is problem somewhere in that house.
29-9-2005|f|I think a family relationship should be a thing like when the man is not around and a decision has to be taken, whatever options the wife decides to take should relates to whatever the husband would have preferred best for them.  The Bible says the TWO shall become ONE.
01-1-2006|f|I tot we were talking about a family here and not a camp of soilders.....haba...whats with the instruction stuff. No one gives instruction, rather we all, including the kids give opinion and delibrate and the parents now agree on the issue. Giving instructions sounds more like a boss to her secretary or smthg like tha.

25-3-2005|m|What would you say about ladies dating married men? Is it right or wrong?
26-3-2005|f|When I was a bit younger than now, I only saw things in black and white. At such a time I would have assertively condemned any such lady. Now however, when shades of grey appear to exist besides black and white, I say it depends.  Generally speaking, it is morally and spiritually wrong. There are however instances wherein it might be permitted, while not recommended. Take for instance a man married to a woman who is mentally challenged and in a mental institution, he might seek solace and companion from another woman.  Please do not get me wrong, I am by no means permitting it under any circumstance. Spiritually there is absolutely no defence or ground for it. But judging such women without actually knowing the circumstances surrounding such relationships might be too hasty in extremely few cases.  Personally though, I do not recommend it to any woman.
26-3-2005|f|There is absolute no excuse for a woman to date a married man or for a man to date a married woman or whatt ever! The guy is married for crying out loud! Ok, what if your woman was going out with another guy while you guys are still on? I mean that is absolutely and totally wrong! And one would not find it funny then.  Dating a married man or woman will finally bring chaos to the family, and it is going to break up the family, and the kids are usually the once that have to bear the consequencies. What happened to "till death do us part?" I mean, if you ain't going to keep to that you might as well save everyone from all the drama!!
27-3-2005|m|Interesting. Well, dating a married man might be cool to some, an unforgiveable crime to a few, and a taboo to many. The question here tends to link with moralities which guide us toward so called right paths and justified reasoning. Well the point here we need to address and judge from is what really, this dating involves or all about? Is it just a friendly dinner as friends? Or something that would lead to bed?  If that issue is addressed then we would be able to pinpoint, on what is good and what is bad. And therefore a good angle of argument can be launched. I classify hitting the issue from a religious angle really lame. Please let the issue at stake be addressed, and let's remove emotions. Thank you.
29-3-2005|f|Yeah, well, I do agree that the issue of religion is not a key role in the discussion. I mean, different religions have various ways they do their own thing. But but when people say 'dating', it is no longer like a friend to friend association. If friends are going out, well they are hanging out, and not going out on a date. Dating already puts the whole relationship at a different level.  So I still think that it is wrong no matter what context it is viewed from. One of the person is still married and has a family.
30-3-2005|m|Our society is polygamous in nature. And from the look of it, we have more women than men. This explains the reason why some women will date a married man, especially if she doesn't mind becoming a second, third or fourth wife, as the case may be.  But as for the man, he knows what he is looking for. If he has a wife at home and is dating other women outside, then that is wrong. It should not be encouraged. If he is separated or divorced and dating other women, maybe he wants to marry another wife. It doesn't matter whether he is a christian or muslim, he may not have the grace to remain like that.  It is also possible for a married man to date women, not for the purpose of sex, but just for friendship or companionship. Maybe he is having problem in his home, or the wife have been sicked for a long time, etc. He just wants the friendship of a woman, somebody who understands.  So, it is better to examine each situation and circumstances separately before raising condemnation or commendation. But I make bold to say that a man that have a wife at home and started looking outside for sex is clearly in the wrong, morally or spiritually speaking.
31-3-2005||Why for God's gracious sake would you want to take something that doesn't belong to you?  I don't blame girls that do that. Instead, I hold the men responsible. What happend to 'deliver us from every temptation'? Fine, some girls are |bad|, so why not run when you see them ('Jezebels') coming? Please, if you really do love your woman and dont believe the phrase "variety is the spice of life" should apply to every thing in life. You won't fall into their hands if you don't want to.  Yes, some girls were born home breakers, maybe because of their background; broken home or because they just want this "complete man" and share in the joy he is giving someone else. Like Yorubas would say, 'Olojukokoro'(greedy person).  I believe, if you are having problems with your wife, you should go to God in prayers. Talk to him, I'm too sure He'll work things out.
31-3-2005|f|Really, really, i think we should call a spade a spade. Wen you look at it from different perspectives, you would definitely have varying opinions. I am looking at it from the xtian angle now whereby it is one man one wife. A lady dating a married man: wat kind of date is that? Are they just friends or have an intimate relationship? If it is that their relationship in non-platonic then it is absolutely wrong cos I believe as the same lady, wen you get married you would not even want to hear the fact that your husband is dating some other woman! So do unto others what you want to be done to you.
01-4-2005|f|okies i think we have dis all wrong. there is a difference between and i think tht is where we all got it wrong! dating is with the intention tht it would lead to somfin else. if they r just friends then they do not date. when friends go out they r HANGING OUT not DATING. i was justhaving dis conversation wif a friend and i figured tht ppl have got the meaning all wrong. so from dis topic of conversation, the indication is that the man or the woman has got other intention i n mind not just mere hanging out. if i am wrong pls correct me. i am taking a stand on my opinion. unless the person tht started the topic meant dating as otherwise.
01-4-2005|f|First of all the answer to the question is , it is wrong for a lady to date a married man and nothing justifies that action. Alrightie! The golden rule states" Do unto others what you want them to do to you" with that I say, let's judge ourselves okay! would you be happy if some woman is dating your husband?
01-4-2005|m|Defining "going out" or Dating. Is it the issue? . Well we do have to define it to be able to understand what it is all about. The threads topic if I am not mistaken was on "Dating".  Now for a married man to be dating in wedlock is totally wrong. Dating the married man also is wrong too. There is infact nothing to justify the date, except in a scenario whereby the lady is going to be his second or third or even fourth wife and thats with the consent of his other wives or wife, then that can be a reasonable excuse. Well we live in a world where polygamy is practiced especially in a country like Nigeria, so i guess we cant raise an alarm if we happen to see someone going for a second wife.  When it comes to going out, well its OK. The married man can go out with any lady he wants, providing its "going out" which from my own understanding means just hanging out for a dinner or maybe a visit to a place.
02-4-2005|f|Whichever view one decides to adopt, really, it's wrong. What I was trying to say earlier is that some situations are better judged after you've had a close shave or a near experience. I'm not saying I have and I sincerely pray that I never fall that weak but the fact remains that I've come across loads of people of both sexes who found themselves prey. These are not bad people we're talking about, they dont have horns or any such thing, and quite to the contrary, they're hunks and babes by anyone's standards. That's beside the point. I'm saying no one sets out to hurt their spouses in this manner, well, no one in their right minds. Yet, unfortunately enough, it happens every minute. As we speak, someone's husband is busy trying to find out what colour or designer another woman favours in her choice of underwear. It's disheartening at best, I know, but the cruel fact remains that it happens and our society condones it. Guys, stop sounding like it's an alien idea, it's not right but it's happens just like practically every other thing that obtains in our society. May God help us all. And just for the record, what right or time does a married man/woman have to 'hang out' with someone of the opposite sex? Where is her husband, where are the kids? Once hanging out entails getting dressed up, leaving the house and meeting up with a man/woman without your spouses knowledge, let alone consent, there's fire on the mountain.
02-4-2005|m|I suppose someone else's wife is also having her underwear examined by another man.  Here's how I see it. People set out to have affairs for various reasons, but they figure out that "what you know won't hurt you". Therefore as long as they don't get caught, they think "no problem". Let's face it, it's a matter of integrity. I don't think this 'temptation' thing is hard to resist as such.
06-4-2005|m|The ratio of women to men in Nigeria is definitely not 6 to 1! According to Motherland Nigeria, there were 54.61 million women to 55.92 million men in 1998, a ratio of about 98 women to 100 men! So there's no reason for polyamorous men to feel justified.  Single ladies, isn't that wonderful? There are more than enough men to go around!
27-4-2005|m|Dating a married man is not something good, but nowadays, it has become something of pride among the ladies. In addition, some of them go into this because of money. Therefore I can say one of the factors that is responsible for this is poverty.
28-4-2005|m|Brother, I think you are right, those who are doing it are doing it because of money, poverty. But in my view they are better than those on the road into prostitution.
28-4-2005|f|I beg to disagree.  When I was a student in UI, it was the in thing to date married men. Infact it was more common and natural than brushing your teeth. Now, if you take a closer look at 90% of the babes into this 'trade', such as it is, they are by far not from poor homes. Most of them are from very comfortable backgrounds. They do it for the money alright but let's not confuse poverty with greed here.  We are all of the popular consensus that however wrong it is, it is common place now for married men and even women (God help us) to have scores of affairs, but it still does not make it right.
29-4-2005|m|Bros, when I think about the campus life of the girls, most of them are doing it because of greed. And some are being lured into the act of dating these men because of what they will gain from the men. But some some of the working class ladies are dating married men ether for fun or for security or greed.
12-5-2005|f|God of mercy, forgive those who date a married man. There is no two ways about it, if a man is not married to you he is not your husband.  I cannot date a married man. Dating a married man you are puting a curse upon yourself; for God's sake this man is not yours and he can't be yours no matter how close you are. You are putting the family in pains; this man will turn his back from his family. He'll pay attention to you alone and this will cause damage to the family.  If you date a married man now, someone else will date your man tommorrow, then you will feel a taste of it.
12-5-2005|f|Hey, hope, I completely understand your aversion for the practise. What goes around, as the saying goes, comes around.
27-5-2005|f|Omo, na the best oh.  As long as you know how to play your cards, there's noting wrong with it.  These married man are more experienced in every area than these young boys. I mean every area: they can spend any amount for you, do anything, and besides that, pamper you.  But mind you, it should be just dating o. Wise up, don't ever think of getting married to them, else you'll smell fire when you get there.
27-5-2005|m|Do we really need to answer this topic?  For those that are single, let them tell me how it feels when years down the line they have marital problems because one silly charlatan (male or female) refuses to leave their spouse alone.  And for those who are married, when the **** hits the fan, I hope they'll be around to enjoy the repercussions and ramifications of their actions..  There's no justification, period. If you want to go that route, why get married?
27-5-2005|f|I guess then, one should welcome a young gurl dating her husband with arms wide open
28-5-2005|f|mosiate dearie, wake up from this serious slumber of urs.. would u be happy as a married woman if u know ur husband is dating a young girl elsewhere..c'mon girl..its for real "wat goes around comes around"  there's no card to be played here.. this is simply very wrong cut the craps, dont date a married man, there re many single guys out there who re richer than married men (if u want to date for money), who can pamper u & do anything for u... its just that we all know most single guys re not level headed.. but the nice ones re still out there o!! waiting for u to jump into their arms.. if u really want rich guys & other qualities.. move with the classy girls.. B4 u say "jack robinson" u re already dating a rich dude
28-5-2005|f|wrong!
28-5-2005|f|It is inexcusable for a lady to date a married man, especially young ladies in our higher institutions of learning. Imagine how it would feel for someone to be dating your husband when you know you have what it takes.  Doesn't feel nice abi??  And that man self, wetin be your own? One woman no do you? Abeg keep "randy Thomas" in check oh! Discipline yourself.
29-5-2005|m|Date a married man? I think that is the height of irresponsiblity on the part of any female!  Agreed, some men can't keep their thing in their trousers, but does any intelligent, right thinking lady have to be the WC into which they pour their excess fluid? Or the machine upon which they realise their sexual urges?  A lady with respect for herself will realise she should not be second fiddle or a play-thing for any man, no matter the reward. What goes around would definitely come around.
30-5-2005|f|I agree, only I would say it's irresponsible on the part of the both the male and the female.  I also think that men aren't given enough credit for their ability to keep their "thing" in their trousers. As far as I know, they were born with a functioning brain (the one in their heads) too, just like women were. So I think reference to the fact that it's so "difficult" to control your urges is just ridiculous and really is just an excuse for bad behaviour.  I wholeheartedly agree with your final point: it's all about having self respect and knowing that you deserve the best for yourself and that would be someone who can devote all of themself to you.
31-5-2005|m|That is not the best way of dating. We have young men and women that fit your standard with all potentials. Why darting married man or woman?  That is why our young boys and girls go for that because it pays. but remember
31-5-2005|m|What is all this? We all know this is wrong but it's still done by every where. So what are we debating on here?  Puleez.
26-3-2005|f|Top ten  There are movies and there are movies as we all must know but there are some movies I really love. I must have seen them a million times but I'll see them again at the drop of a hat.  The other day, I sat down to see all four of Mario Puzo's 'Godfather'. I couldn't help marvelling at Al Pacino's and Rob Deniro's combined acting talents all over again.  Another one is 'The Shawshank Redemption' - amazing film. Usual suspect- absolutely amazing.  'Murder In The First' -- about Alcatraz and the hideous things that went on in those cells before it was finally shut down.  I love 'Pretty Woman' as well on the lighter side.  Ah well, I could go on forever about the films I love but I best give you guys a chance to do the same. So, who likes any of these films as much as I do?  Ciao.
01-4-2005|m|Well, I am a science-fiction movie addict but I definitely like the 'Godfather' trilogy and 'Any Given Sunday' (also by Al Pacino). I like the tango scene he performed in 'Scent Of A Woman' but 'The Last Samurai' is one of the films I watch every few days.  'Bourne Supremacy' is also a film I like. The 'Lord Of The Rings' trilogy, The 'Matrix' trilogy (interesting that I always seem to watch films in threes), 'Troy' and 'King Arthur'. I am still waiting to get a CD of 'Alexander'.  Well, those are mine.
02-4-2005|f|It's amazing, but you definitely sound like a guy after my heart ... well, film wise  Those are by far my favourites of all times as well. I must have seen 'Bourne Identity' and 'Bourne Supremacy' at least a zillion times. 'Casino', 'Last Don' ... I could just go on and on ...
02-4-2005|f|Just saw 'Finding Forrester', absolutely fantastic. I've not had the opportuinty of watching 'Godfather' and don't even tell people, its such a shame! All the seasons of '24' could make u stay indoors for two days. The suspense is remarkable. Been out of tune for a while now and looking forward to watching 'Hotel Rwanda' and 'Diary of a mad black woman'. I love epic films, comedy, action, sci-fi, cartoon and thriller. Don't talk about best-sellers.  Anybody loves books?
02-4-2005|m|Here is a link to our section on Books and Reading. Please feel free to post reviews of your favorite books there.
03-4-2005|f|delarontus: 'Finding Forrester is, as you put it, is absolutely fantastic. Now, 'Hotel Rwanda' you must look for and see. I wish I could post my copy to you. It's an amazing film. I've seen it 3 times in the last week and there's no getting used to it.
03-4-2005|m|delarontus, here's a special warning: be ready to cry when you watch 'Hotel Rwanda'! Read Ra's account of the first time she watched the film here: 
05-4-2005|f|Favourite movies? If I were to start listing em, then I guess it would take up space! I love watching movies a lot and I have quite a number of them i could keep watching over and over again; 'Heat' by Al Pacino and Robert de Niro, 'Three Kings', 'Lock, stock and two smoking barrels' , 'Godfather', 'Best man'and a host of odas!
06-4-2005|f|Dominobaby I don't know how u did it but I did not like 'Lock Stock & Two Smoking Barrels' whatever, because I didn't understand it. Long time ago though!  Seun, thanks for the advice. I'll get prepared.  Ra, I think you do have a taste for good films
06-4-2005|f|Thanks girl...... , that's me blushing there.
07-4-2005|f|delarontus: The first time I also watched it, I barely liked it. But the second time I got hooked. You really need to listen to every word and follow it; you sure will like it. Long time since I watched it, too, but I wouldn't mind it any time t.
07-4-2005||i got lots o fmovies i like. but if i'm to pick my favourite it'll probably be "my girl "  maybe cos deep down i'm an emotional guy. teh film still makes me cry
11-4-2005|f|Talking about movies again, I heard someone utter a statement barely an hour ago that reminded me of a film I saw ages ago and loved so much. I can't remember just how many times I saw the movie in question but let's just say that I can still say so many lines from it offhand. I'm talking about the all time comedy 'See No Evil, Hear No Evil'. Now that was some funny film. For the benefit of those who never saw this film, please go to your nearest video club on Friday night, curl up on the sofa and have a wild time laughing all the way preferably with your husband, wife, partner, b/gfriend as the case may be. Two friends; one blind, one deaf dominated the film to the end; hence, it's all telling title.  Moving on to heavier stuff, some might start thinking I'm obsessed if I say I saw Hotel Rwanda again last weekend , well I did.  Let me tell you a bit about the film, enough to whet your appetite. For starters, it's a true life story about the genocide in Rwanda. The film is so perfect that you actually momentarily forget you are not in Rwanda. The emotion that wracks through you to the very end reassures you that there is hope left for humanity yet. It is the story of a man who single-handedly saved the lives of so many people. Well, maybe I shouldn't say single-handedly because some of his hotel staff helped him out.  The man was none other than Don Cheadle (starred in Ocean 11 &12, Sword Fish amongst other films). What never fails to amaze me is how this American mastered the Rwandan accent so perfectly. Well, I must add that he spent a long time in Rwanda prior to the shooting and met with the man whose life he sought to portray (Paul Rusesabagina) who is still very much alive.  In another part of this forum we were discussing what makes a man the head of his family and how respect is earned by him. If and when you see this film, you will marvel at the faith and complete trust the wife (acted by our own Sophie Okonedo, a Nigerian, an Ibo girl, though she was born and weaned in the UK) had in her husband. The husband is Hutu (the ruling tribe) while the wife is Tutsi (the minority massacred in Rwanda). It was like the case of the uproars between Ishekiris and Ijaws in Warri. You know Ijaws married to Itshekiris and vice versa were killed during the crisis, some even by their very husbands. But this guy stood up to provide a refuge for his wife's people together with others who were merely neighbours and those who ran to him for help.  He disregarded his own life and submitted himself to fate. He even managed a sense of humour through it all. The only reason Ray Charles got the OSCAR and Hotel Rwanda didnt is simply because it is still very fresh in victims memories and might lead to a crisis in America between whites and blacks based on the way the whites in Rwanda treated the indigenes when they were in dire trouble and needing their help. And of cause, forgive this escaping my memory; the whites started the whole problem in the first place by empowering the Hutus and then leaving the Tutsis in government.  The best thing, really, is to see this movie. It is now available on DVD and I'm sure you can obtain a copy if you go to any major film shop or something. If you see it and it's anything less than I've proclaimed, please feel free to have a go at me... only don't swear please!
12-4-2005|f|[I]em[/I], Ra, I think you have done some kind of advert for this film. I'll try find it out. That reminds me of the advert for Troy done by the [I]Silverbird Cinemas[/I] when they first started operations. The advert was much more catchy than that done by the movie producers themselves. So long!
12-4-2005|f|My favourite all-time movie is 'Sound of Music'. As a kid, I loved watching it and even now I still watch it and still have that same feeling of awe about the movie.  I loved 'Tripple Bleep' with Vin Diesel. Man oh man, is that guy hot? I also like 'Lord of the Rings' (all three of them)! Men that movie deserved all the Oscars it collected! I mean, I am still amazed at the whole production, scene, suspense, romance, combat, pictography etc. And I love New Zealand! I hope to settle there one day or at least stay there a couple of years! And men is Aragon hot or what?  Gosh, I have a lot of movies that I love. 'Finding Nemo', that was pretty neat and cute! The Incredibles!, Constantine! You guys have got to see that movie! 'Resident Evil', men I loved when the laser thing that was going on in the room when they were trapped and then when the guy was sliced up like in cubes because the laser beam changed to that formation (ok, I mean that is kind of gross but it was a good visual effect!)  'Hitch' was not all that bad but men Will Smith has come a long way! That man is hot hot hot! I mean, look at him now and him then (as Fresh Prince of Bel Air) I mean I give him props for that body! Jada is such a lucky woman!  Gosh, I can go on and on. I also like Anastasia (the Disney production cartoon). I mean I can also watch it many times and still enjoy it like I first did also 'Mulan'.
25-4-2005|m|Well, Aragon is cool but Legolas is more handsome (looks like a Viking). Anyway, being a guy, I'll say Arwen is the coolest of the whole bunch. I particularly like Gimli because he keeps grumbling.  Anybody watched 'Hackers Unite'? Fairly old but quite interesting.
03-5-2005|f|I love romantic films and most times i find myself watching India films. Who love india films?
03-5-2005|m|Last week, I watched the ''Indiana jones triology'' all over again. I think Sean Connery is doing well in old age. I enjoyed ''the rock''. I've seen ''the league of Extra-ordinary gentlemen too''. But one of my best movies of all time is ''the game'' by Michael Douglas.

09-5-2005|f|I like movies, but tripping for 'Keeping Faith', and I would love to see 'The Godfather' because I have not seen it yet.  Most especially, I love bestsellers especially 'Save the Last Dance' and some Indian films.

28-3-2005|m|Has anybody heard of the digital cable antenna? I saw one the other day. It's capable of recieving feeds from all the popular cable channels and is sold for less than a quarter of the normal cost. That's really cool.
01-4-2005|f|Sure, I use one at home. I get cable stations like CNN, channel O, MTV base, skysports and movies, discovery channel and some others. Nigerian cable TV.
05-4-2005|m|Can someone tell me the actual cost of this Low cost device, and if it will work in Ogun State.
07-4-2005|f|Pls, i want to know the cost too and how/where to get it in Lagos.
07-4-2005|f|@ Angelgirl and Shallar 1. When it first got to the market, it sold for between N10K and N15K, but now I hear it is sold for between 5K and 7K. I must one you though the cable stations are sometimes scrambled i.e they somtimes withhold some stations, just to make us subscribe, Channels that are always clear are Channel O, Discovery Channel, all Nigerian cable tv, cartoon network.  I don't know if it will work in Ogun state but don't see any reason why it shouldn't.
17-4-2005|m|how much is the subscription per month and plz someone list all the channels available on this thingy ASAP.  It seems this is the best alternative to DSTV which is so damn expensive..  I'm gonna get this thing right away....
17-4-2005|m|The fact that this thread exists just goes to show how price-sensitive the working class Nigerian is!
19-4-2005|m|Well, working class or not, Seun, its free. Mamba, you don't have to visit the bank every month. Just buy, install and watch.
19-4-2005|m|Is it legal?
21-4-2005|m|It is not illegal for you to build your own antenna. I believe it is only illegal if you start making a profit from it like collecting money for TV matches. Anyway, it's a microwave dipole antenna and can easily be converted to a radio antenna, so I believe its not really a crime.  Apart from that, Nigerians are crime tolerant [I](that's why we bribe policemen and pay extra when we pay our normal NEPA or NITEL tariffs.)[/I]
02-5-2005|m|shallar1, i'm not sure the stuff will work in ogun state for the simple fact that there needs to be a cable base station in the vicinity for it to work. i have been in abeokuta a number of times and i have not seen anyone use it.  u have to make do without it for some time i guess
02-8-2005|m|Please, Trish and others, I am new here and loved to have much idea on this cable. Woes it work in Port Harcourt in Rivers state? I live in Bonny island and would like to know if I can also use it there in my house. I am strongly interested O, please.  Philcool Bonny island Rivers state
14-8-2005|m|Trish,  Pleeeeeeeeeeeease help me on more info about the cable. I live in Rivers state pleeeeeeeeeeeeease.  Thank you inanticipation, Phil
29-8-2006|m|pls o. me 2 de interested in diz cable stuff. but can it work in abuja. i hope EFCC wount arest me 4 using it, bcoz u neva can tell wat de do dis dayz. i havent seen it in d market. so where can i buy it 4rm thnkz
30-8-2006|f|why are u scared of EFCC getting you for one, the cable is bout 5500-7000 naria,,u get a video set and dat originally becomes a cable  Seun asked if it is legal?is installing nigerian antenna illegal,based on the fact that we do not pay any thing again after buying it and installing  Most times they knowingly swith off the channels and it goes blank.To me it is a trial and error method of watching cable. ;
25-4-2011|m|Guess someone at Multichoice was taking notes. They crashed the price down anyway. Still interested though.
27-4-2011||@kodewrita, dude I guess d only reason u revive ds post is 'cos u d creator of it. Dude its bin like 5 yrs & d so-called cable antenna is like out of use. Whats d point! ''sighs
28-4-2011|m|its not about cost any longer. now am into learning about cable generally. own a few decoders from different provders but am a neophyte when it comes to installation and other key technical stuff.
29-3-2005|f|Why is it that men shy away from doing house work? I mean, even if it is helping out but not doing the entire housework themselves? Has it got to do with masculinity? Other than the fact that it had been like that for generations, I would like to hear your opinion on that.
29-3-2005|m|Personally, I hate housework. I just don't enjoy the idea of working on a job that never finishes! [list][li]You dust your furniture, and when you check it the day after it's dusty again.[/li] [li]You prepare food for people and in the next few hours, they are hungry again.[/li] [li]You tidy up a room in the morning and in the course of normal use it's untidy by evening.[/li] [li]Taking care of children, however, is rewarding because they grow and learn.[/li][/list]  So, I hate housework. And if our culture gives me [I]a good excuse[/I] to limit my participatipation, hurray! I am sure many men feel the same way. We just don't like housework very much; the gender thing is just an excuse.
30-3-2005|m|Except for Chefs, men don't normally grow up doing house chores. In our own part of the world, men are brought up to do the hard work, while the female species takes care of the housework like cookings, watching, etc. A man sets his mind on greater objectives like the overall finance of the house, family growth, investments, etc. If he have somebody to help him take care of the low-levels works, he is fine and happy.  A man should assist in houseworks whenever the situation demands, otherwise he is judged to be selfish or uncaring. But no man enjoys doing houseworks. Personally speaking, I hate washing dirty plates or putting my hands in cold water to wash clothes. I tried to avoid them as much as possible.
30-3-2005|m|That is why I love time-saving gadgets like:[list] [li]Microwave ovens.[/li] [li]Dishwashers.[/li] [li]Vacuum cleaners.[/li] [li]Washing machines.[/li] [/list]  I wonder why Nigerians don't use them more often. We are being penny wise and pound foolish if we don't realise the importance of these gadgets. People have been using dishwashers and washing machines since the 60s.
31-3-2005|m|Seun,  Everybody likes good things. Nobody likes to suffer or pass long route when there is a shortcut. If everybody can afford it, they will have washing machines, vacuum cleaners, dishwashers, etc. But I know that in the near future, these gadgets will be as common as TVs in Nigerian homes, especially in the homes of the educated. I totally agree with you that these devices saves you times and needless stresses.
31-3-2005|m|Trust me, these things aren't as expensive as you might think. Since my family we moved into our current place of residence more than 10 years ago we have never had less than one refridgerator and one freezer at a time. Yet we did not get a Microwave Oven until someone gave it to us as a gift? Was it too expensive for us? No! It's just that these gadgets are not yet part of our culture. Microwave ovens and vacuum cleaners are quite cheap, and a washing machine or dishwasher isn't so expensive when compared to something like a refridgerator.  It's just not yet a part of our culture. Our ladies prefer to bend down to sweep and wash clothes like our forefathers. They haven't learnt the joys of warming food with a Microwave oven's timer and going your merry way with no fear of food getting burnt and no pot to wash! If I get married tommorrow and my wife insists on bending down to do everything she will just have to do it alone!
01-4-2005|m|Well, Seun, I agree with you on the wife thing, but let's also agree that some foods don't just taste well when passed through a food processor (pounded yam for instance, tastes like [I]amala[/I] when the machine is thru with it. That texture pounded-yam lovers want is just not there.  In most cases cost is a factor. I believe it's not a question of culture. Some people have not even heard of a microwave oven, not to talk of seeing one. And when they see one on TV, to them [I]its just another of those fantastic machines used by whitemen[/I].  In my home, we are still lobbying for the vacuum cleaner, dishwasher and washing machine since sweeping, plate-washing and laundry are still the top 3 chores (though, for me, car-washing is a bore and is still the chore I hate most )
02-4-2005|f|I'm simply amazed, to say the least, at this topic and the response so far. Enh, enh, no kidding, so there's a different taste to pounded yam and the machine processed one ? THEN POUND THE YAM YOURSELF, my dear. I'll be too happy to tell you how different it tastes. Then again, is it just me or has any of these guys failed to intimate us of the heavier and more productive things guys are purportedly doing while we wash, rinse, clean, dust, take care of the children and yes, cook ?  It's slave trade all over again, if you ask me. I grudgingly subscribe to Seun's school however. These gadgets are not as expensive as we make them out to be. It's just the mentality. What is wrong with vacuuming my house rather than breaking my back sweeping the whole house when the kids will only unleash havoc in a couple of hours. Especially when Im so allergic to dust! Having said that, it will help if guys bought these things for their wives seeing as they are the ones who allegedly do the 'financial running' of the house as someone said.  Stop kidding yourselves guys, to answer the original question, which Seun was amazingly man enough to truthfully do, you are all simply too lazy to be bothered and if your culture permits, which it undoubtedly does, such laziness, by all means fold yourself under its skirt. Imagine!!
02-4-2005|m|I like to be able set a big goal, achieve it, then revel in the achievement for a while before setting another goal. I don't like doing work which 'never gets done'. Have you heard the phrase "a woman's work is never done?" Poor women!  But I refuse to agree that men are lazy! My mind is made up, so don't confuse me with the facts.
02-4-2005|f|Alright dear, we'll leave it at that but not before I point out that you've just buttressed my point. In that regard simply repeat after me and let's see if you can manage that much. Ready? Steady? Go: Men are lazy! Period!  But we love you anyways (more fool us)
05-4-2005|m|Seun, I agree with you. It is just not yet part of our culture. Any man that can afford a refrigerator or a 21-inch colour television should abe able to afford a dish-washer or a micro-wave oven. It is just not yet our culture, but we are getting there, gradually.
06-4-2005|m|Fasone: That's a nice point.  Below are some thoughts.  - First of all, even in compounds where they have generating sets, we find that they don't always have these gadgets.  - If you are using a washing machine and power goes off, you can take out your clothes and wash them manually or just wait for power to return. This works well for clothes because most people wash clothes only once a week.  - I think there are gas-powered vacuum cleaners.  - Why don't our cookers and microwave ovens come with timers?
07-4-2005|f|hey guys sup? I am glad to see that this is a hot topic. Anyway, I just think that men are lazy. Ok, in the past they were the providers but now things are changing. Now women also are providers, but men still ain't doing much at home. You might say that they are adapting to it because they are not used to it yet. Well, we can stick to that argument to make ourselves happy, but I think that it is just plain laziness. Or ok if you all think that it is too feminine for a man to do house chores, well that is all bull. Because women can easily tackle a man's job and they do pretty good at it. So there ain't no arguing in my point. When I get married hell the guy better know how to do housework, even if it is vacuuming, doing the laundry etc., because it is all gonna be shared out! peace out!
07-4-2005||But why are Nigerian men like this? They are a bunch of pretenders! Imagine when they are still fresh on you what you will hear from them is: "Oh, I like cooking! Would you prefer a lunch at my place, since cooking is one of my hobbies?"  Some will even go on and tell you how their 'Mama' trained them in cooking, and that men are better cooks.  but look look I feel like opening you , you, and you out men's be your sef  None of you have shown any sense of maturity (I'm sorry if I'm sounding insulting).
07-4-2005|m|Hmmm. I can see that this discussion is getting heated, and the ladies are already getting excited.  Chigszy: Just pray that the man you will marry will be understanding and loves doing housework. Otherwise, you cannot force him to do it. The best he can do is to employ a house-maid for you. Even if he loves doing housework, his friends and familiies will discourage him from doing it. Except you are not living in Naija.  Omo-naija: It is natural for a guy to be be nice and try to impress a woman he is just getting fresh with. He can cook, wash and even run errands for her, just to win her approval. The lady is the one in control then. But the moment they are married, situation has changed. It is now the man in control. He does what is convenient for him and what he feels he should do in his own house, even matters like doing house chores.  In short, what I am trying to say is that it is very difficult to get the african mentality out of us men.
08-4-2005|f|Well, diakim, you do not know me so you would not know. Well I am like for equality - well you can call me a feminist - but the guy had better learn how to do house work. I have my ways not to worry about that. I mean, I am very diplomatic about things. You can have your way and say about things but at the end of the day we both have to come to an agreement.  And I do not need to depend on the guy to get me a house help: I can get one myself! Ain't gonna depend on the guy. And we are both going to run the house like the partner we are supposed to be. I will hola at you when that happens to let you now that it is possible.
09-4-2005|m|Ok sister, I will be glad to know when you have successfully domesticated your man. I am sure you know your ways to doing this. Women, I respect and fear them. They know how to have their ways. But softly o, I beg, it might not be that easy..
09-4-2005|m|I am not a domestic animal, and I cannot be domesticated!  You see, Chigzy, I'm probably more of a feminist than you are. But I don't like housework. Now, if my mother has not been able to change me after 23 years of constant nagging, what makes some girl think she can do better? Get real! You can't 'domesticate' a man, because men are not wild animals.  If you are not able to accept everything about your man, please don't marry him. Go and join a convent instead. Afterall, as a nun, you would be married to Jesus who is a perfect man ...
09-4-2005|f|The most 'domestic' of men can only do so much in the home. I certainly do not expect my husband to do the dishes, wash clothes, sweep the house and all such things. In this day and age where both husband and the wife leave the house almost at the same time to get to work, even wives hardly do all of these chores anymore. There are house helps and nannies to make the workload easier. However, there are tasks that remain so intimate that even your househelp cannot go near. All over the world, it is not peculiar to our men, food is notably the fastest weapon to a man's heart. Even men who love cooking leave the task to their wives. Men rarely cook. Theres a hugesatisfaction in eating food prepared by the wife just as an ideal wife loves cooking for her loving husband. In as much as any responsible man will not watch his beloved wife slave away under the heavy burden of housework, domesticating a man is so out of the question. If all your fianc does while you're courting is help you wash the dishes, trust me honey, after marriage,.... well he'll still help out but simply by removing his own socks when he gets in from work. It's a man's world and we can't do anything about it. Most women love and enjoy doing these things for their husbands but there must be again, mutual respect and love between them (the ideal marriage). A man cannot be changed to do as you wish, it's a fantasy. What you see is what you get, so if you don't like what you see now, don't get it in the hope that you know how to handle him. Hate to burst your bubbles girlfriend, but it so does not work that way.
17-4-2005|f|I am still going to stand for what I said because I have seen it done. I have seen men that do houseworks and I think that it is very sweet of them. And I do admire them for that. Ok, what is difficult for a man to walk like a few feet to the washing machine and dump the clothes into it?  Or what is so difficult for him to pick up the vacuum and clean up? Those are the things that men should help out doing. Yeah, one more thing that gets on my nerve is that when women give birth the husband does not even give a hand in cleaning up the baby. The woman is left to do all the work and yet the husband is demanding! Oh that really pisses me off! I mean there are even lots of drama when men are concerned! You men are just very complicated!  Ok, I am frustrated right now from what that has been going on. I will not get into details, so if you found this offensive oh well I am just speaking my mind. Do not get me wrong, I do not eispise men. Seun, oh well if there was a way I could just avoid all the drama involving men well being a nun is not a bad alternative. But I want to have my own kids. Well at the moment I do.
17-4-2005|m|Chigzy, if you want kids so badly I can set you up. Just come to my apartment very late in the night dressed in a certain manner and I'll do the rest  On a more serious note, I think the issue at hand here is this. There are some men who exhibit the bad traits you are describing, and there are some who don't. Just choose the one who understands your point of view and agrees with your way of seeing the world.
03-5-2005||Chigzy,  Is it fair to ask the man to help in the housework if women aren't asked to do 'heavy stuff' like fixing broken down stuff, moving heavy things, etc.?
04-5-2005|m|chigzy,  dont bother your pretty head about how nice that brother would be. if he loves you he wont let you hurt yourself. i know i have great plans for my 'sweetness' and i know i am also lazy ...seun i think you know
04-5-2005|f|Whao! I am really catching fun reading all the posts. But really men should learn to do certain things. What if your wife is out of town? Would you prefer eating from the roadside to preparing your own meal? Come on, let's get real.  Some men are just too lazy? It's so annoying. Afterall there is one thing you men can not do without a woman's help. Yet we do not complain. So why do you find it difficult to help your woman at home.
07-5-2005||Tayotina,  I don't necessarily enjoy cooking, cleaning, washing and other domestic chores, but I am most certainly able to do them and do them well.  The point is, there's something called division of labour (where the different roles to be performed in the house are split up depending on who is relatively better at doing them).  Now I'm good at domestic chores, which my wife may be better than me at doing. I'm also good at handling mechanical and electrical stuff and moving heavy stuff around, which my wife may not be so good at. Doesn't it make sense for me to specialise in the stuff that I'm good at, and leave my wife the handle the other stuff where I am at a disadvantage?  I don't think I would let my domestic skills go to waste even if I wasn't in charge of that area, because there are times that my wife would be unable to perform them. Then I would be able to step into the breach. Also, I don't like being too dependent on other people.  But even if I wasn't able to boil an egg to save my life, I think that as long as I was appreciative of the domestic work that my wife did and I always expressed this appreciation, I don't think that my wife would worry too much about it.
19-5-2005|m|this topic really brought the sparks...looks like the fur was being ruffled the wrong way.  for me personally i hate any frm of house chores . that is why i don't cook(i buy my food) and i'm sorry to tell the feminists here...i will probably take my time out to look for a girl who can cook my food!!!  all the gadgets seun mentioned are really worthwhil...that is if there is power
23-5-2005||I know that some guys around me don't like doing house work because they claim they never say their dads doing it, so why should they! They revert to culture and claim its the womans job, to cook , clean and all that. Its amusing because when it comes to working, they complain about the bills and still expect the girls to chip in to make it easier. Fellas its a two way street. If you use culture, go all the way and not half.  But then again, there are a few guys who do housework and in return they expect appreciation like they've given you diamonds. There is just no winning!
29-6-2005|m|I can never be domesticated. Or what do you mean about domesticating Nigerian Men? It sounds ambiguous but then I can help my wife in some domestic work e.g ironing, washing and cooking in part and in full if she is indisposed.
30-6-2005|m|@tayotina Africana has done away with our fears with regards to feeding when the wives are not in town. Just drive to the nearest tantalizer's outlet and treat yourself to their Yam porridge(i believe thats their best dish) or something else.  @Ka I agree there should be division of labour. it is not easy to keep count of how many questions have been passed on "Who wants to be a millionaire " and cook at the same time. she will do the cooking, i will help her watch the tv (of course i provided the funds for the dish so its not entirely on her side.)
01-7-2005|f|I don't mind doing all the house-chores and cooking but hell will break loose if I go on a long trip and I come back to meet the house dirty and no food for me to eat. I will do all the work when I'm around and well but he MUST do everything when I'm away, ill or pregnant. If not [I]katakata go burst[/I].
04-7-2005|m|If I may ask, where is the rule book that says a man should not do housework? If you are living as a bachelor, who do you expect to do your laundry, cook, clean the house?  I personally see nothing degrading in doing housework. I have no qualms about going into the kitchen and whipping up a delicious dish. I certainly have no reason to eat and expect someone to wash my dishes for me.  I marry a wife, a partner, a friend.... NOT A SLAVE. So all you guys looking on your wives to do this for you, una better go look for servants cos thats what u need not a wife.
01-4-2005|m|I believe whatever it may be that you pray for as a christian, you should pray to God the Father in the name of his Son Jesus Christ. I believe that answers your question. From what I understand from the scriptures, he was sent to earth to bring us back to God. Therefore he is the intermediary.  Read more and pray more.
10-4-2005|f|The Bible is indeed confusing to a lay man or even to young converts. As with everything else, the more you read the Bible and meditate on it, the clearer the Holy Spirit makes what you read. Now with regards to praying amiss. I very strongly believe that what the Bible refers to here 'You get not because you pray amiss' is the fact that some people ask God for things that are so not biblical, hence, unacceptable and un-grantable. Whatever it is you want from God, the Bible emphatically says for you to pray to Him through His son Jesus Christ. He Himself said 'and whatever it is you want from God, ask it in my name and it shall be yours'. We can not compartmentalize our prayers, some to God and some to His Son Jesus Christ. An example of asking amiss is an unmarried or single woman praying for a child, God does not support that and such request may never be granted. A junior employee who is not ready to be corrected or adapt to company policy fervently praying for a promotion, a housewife coveting another's husband and praying for him to notice her in return.... all these are asking or praying amiss and those requests are never granted, at least not by God, of that I'm sure. But whatever request is biblical, whatever prayer seeks to promote and promulgate the goodnews of God, whatever our desires are that tally with God's wishes for our lives and those around us... these requests are best made to God through His Son and with a little patience where necessary and applicable, we are bound to get the full physical manifestation.
16-6-2005|m|Who is layman, a dogmatic man that take false things as real in the name of believe "Both sorrow and joy are constantly rapping at the door to encourage and arouse man to awaken spiritually. He is then very often freed for a few seconds from the trivialities of everyday life, and in happiness or grief vaguely senses his affinity with the spirit pulsating through all that lives."  Bible emphatically says for you to pray to Him through His son Jesus Christ. pure dogman, believe and settle with yr 10% abi pastor must chop.
23-6-2005|m|For you not to pray amiss you must know the will of God, His Promises. You must study the word of God as to know his intensions and will for your life. Pray and use His word reminding him of what He has promised. You can pray amiss for example you are single and you're praying for a child where will the child come from? Out of wedlock? Or you are a student praying Jeep or mercedes car. You wan thief?
14-3-2007|f|@topic,  Prayer is a wonderful resource of the Christian believer. People of many faiths 'pray'; but what really is prayer for the Christian, and how can we strengthen our prayer lives?  It is such a blessing to know that when we come to pray, we can come in the confidence of trusting God as our FATHER. Jesus said, "When ye pray, say, Our Father which art in heaven" (Luke 11:2). This immediately brings us to a relationship and takes away the religiosity which so many people are accustomed.  Another blessing of this relationship is that we are loved by the Father in exactly the same way that He loved the divine Son Jesus Christ. "As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in my love" (John 15:9). What is it that the Father would deny the Son? Absolutely nothing! Think of it for a moment. "He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?" (Rom. 8:32).  At the basic level, when we come before God in prayer knowing that we are His children with whom He is pleased to give whatever we ask, our faith will be refreshed and strengthened. However, prayer is offered in the name of His Son Jesus Christ, and with trusting confidence that we ask according to God's will.  To Him be glory for ever.
31-3-2005|m|Any Jazz lover in the forum? Who is your favourite Jazz artist and what are your favourite Jazz tracks? How often do you listen to Jazz music? Lets talk Jazz,  I have several favaourite Jazz artists, but notably the best among them is Dave Koz, Kenny G (the great saxophonist) and Yanni (aka as the Jazzmaster).  There is no day that pass without my listening to Jazz. I even have my favourite tracks loaded on my cellphone which is capable of playing MP3.
02-4-2005|f|I love Najee cos he has introduced some kind of beats into the whole thing. Like Dave Koz, Kenny G but generally i love music so maybe not too much jazz
05-4-2005|m|Our own Kunle Ajayi cannot be overlooked also. He is making waves in South Africa. He is very good with the saxophone. He will soon be another Dave Koz.
06-4-2005|f|I love music to bits. I've been in the choir all my life, well not presently anyways. Yeah, I love jazz but I must say my favorite of all times remain Kenny G. True talk about Kunle Ajayi too. People who've got the wherewithal such as venue, artists and the modalities should really think about organizing jazz nights once in a while, you'll be amazed how soothing it is to the soul. That's the effect of good music generally anyway not disorganized noise like DMX or the likes. Sorry o DMX lovers.
07-4-2005|m|Yes Ra, As if you read my thoughts.  Somebody who 've got the wherewithals and know-hows should organise Jazz nights once in a while. Recently a Jaz Festival was organised in Jo'burg, South Africa, featuring reknowned Jazz artists from African and other parts of the world. The organisers charged $1,500 dollars (all inclusive) to go for the programme from Nigeria.  I would have loved to be there, and I wished I am rich enough to afford such trip. And to think that I was in Jo'burg just 2 weeks before the event, barely missing it.  Anyway, Jazz is gradually becoming a recognised music in Nigeria. Thanks to Kunle Ajayi & co. So, it is just a question of time before we start having such events in Nigeria.
12-5-2005|m|JAzz. don't i just love the sound of it...the new guys are good but at heart i am still an old school fella.  I still think no one can beat Louis Armstrong and Chet Baker when it comes to trumpets, and when it comes to sax: Buddy Arnold is my fellow anytime.  Jazz in naija is still growing and i hope the day is near when we'll have jaz festivals
12-5-2005|m|By the way, does anyone know of any Jazz club in Lagos? Or is there any club where they feature regular jazz artists?  I know of Jazz Hole at Awolowo Road, Ikoyi. But them they only sell Jazz audio music and general African music and books.
17-5-2005|f|Jazz lovers can tune to Rhythm 93.7 fm on Sundays at 8 p.m and enjoy Jazz with Ben Ofili a.k.a 'Buffly".
24-6-2005||Wow! Finally a place I can discuss My passion....JAZZ!! Jazz is my life and my life is jazz. I listen to all kinds of jazz including smooth jazz, traditional jazz and swing jazz which is my fav! Apparently, I also play an instrument too, the electric bass. and love to groove different styles of jazz with my band. I have tons of Jazz CDs in my house and listen to jazz everyday. I also own a World Space Radio and listen to "Riff" a channel dedicated to jazz music. Has anybody heard of Bright Gain? He's a Nigerian jazz virtuoso who play like a 'beast'. He's to me the greatest jazz musician in this country. I also like T-Mark...the half Itshekiri half swiss flutist.  The problem with Nigeria is that we are not used to 'listening' music but we love 'dance music'. Jazz is an art that can only be enjoyed by a matured mind...a mind that can comprehend its message. albeit, we are getting there...more people are beginning to like the music.
24-6-2005||Someone said something about looking for a place where he/she can listen to live jazz.  I dont live in Lagos anymore but I remember Ojez club ,Onike every 3 Sunday or so by 5pm. You'll have to pay a gate fee.  Sometimes, there are jazz gigs at "The Lords Club" Mary Land and Muson Center. which are usually announced in the media.  Regards!
11-10-2005||Nigeria has had a tradition of jazz influenced players over the years and even in the 80's we had our own international jazz festivals where Dizzy was a guest of honour and Toshiko akiyoshi played with her big band.  Of all the musicians playing now both at home and abroad i think funsho ogundipe of ayetoro has been able to create a nigerian sound based on jazz . i remember his songs something dey from 98 and also the new one being played on lagos radio Naija blues pt2. u can check out his band website (www.ayetoro.com)
02-11-2005|m|I am a Jazz man, i am jazz bassist, i listen to dave weckl john coltrane miles davis, the breckers brother john patitucci and ofcourse i listen to myself
04-11-2005|m|my first post, w00t! Anyway to name a few jazz artists that I like, I really dig the Marsalis family, Wynton, Bradford... and of course Yanni ranks up there for me as well. Hugh Masekela is another artist that I really love to listen to, his tribute to Fela is nice.
05-11-2005||Hello! Could Darlingbas be the famous Darlington on the Bass! Spectrum4! If it is, welcome to nairaland! I've listened to you play before and you've got such incredible tone on the bass. I play a lot of jazz too and I love walking the bass a lot. I love Jaco Pastorius (R.I.P), Bright Gain, Charlie Mingus to mention a few. I also love the jazz messengers...Wyton, Bradford, Art Blakey..tight!!
06-11-2005|m|Coltrane and Miles Davis fan. I just love the eery sound of Davis' trumpet. His interpretations of Spanish classics in Sketches of Spai[/i]n chill me to the bone and bring tears to my eyes. If I need some real emotions, I just put on Davis. [i]Kind of Blue is probably the standard to beat when it comes to improvising. Absolutely stunning
16-11-2005|m|Who listens to free jazz? i'm a sucker for bebop but i'm also impartial to ragtime & free jazz, I saw the leading proponent - Ornette Coleman @the Cheltenham jazz festival, hard work but nonetheless rewarding!
16-11-2005|m|nferyn, have you listened to trane's collaboration with Don Cherry - The Avant Garde? A mind boggling take on Ornette Coleman's classics...
16-11-2005|m|No I haven't, but you make me curious. I don't really know Jazz all that well. There are some things I like and that I want to listen to over and over again. Apart from that, I'm just an ignoramus on the subject. I'm quite happy you want to educate me though
16-11-2005|m|Ornette coleman's "Free jazz, a collective improvisation by the OC double quartet" was a huge inspiration for Trane's 1965 Ascension album.  On John Coltrane & Don Cherry album,Trane's sheets of sound meets the Ornette coleman's harmolodics sound, however Ornette is missing on this album, this album or any of the ones i mentioned are not for people of weak construction, if you like music where a lot is going on behind the scenes then this album is a must, but I must warn you it has a very quirky nature...
16-11-2005|m|Apologies for getting ahead of myself, please find below wikipedia's definition of free jazz:  Free jazz, or avant-garde jazz, is a movement of jazz music characterized by diminished dependence on formal constraints. Developed in the 1950s and 1960s, it was pioneered by artists such as Ornette Coleman, Cecil Taylor, Albert Ayler, Archie Shepp, Bill Dixon and Paul Bley. Some of the best known examples are the later works of John Coltrane. [i][/i]  To put it mildly, it is highly improvised, adventurous & unstructured jazz to the nth degree...
17-11-2005||Free jazz is very cool. i personally like Sun ra and a guy called sunny murrar who is the don of free jazz drumming. there are some cool compilations you can find on the net especially about the new york loft scene. check out ascension by coltrane and the live at the village vanguard recordings. smoking stuff!!!!

17-11-2005|m|I'll check sunny murray out, but elvin jones still ranks as my favourite drummer of all times, his frenetic energy knocks me out.  Sun Ra? he's a bad (as in cool) guy, so are Albert Ayler & the father of them all - Ornette Coleman, he takes no prisoners....
25-12-2005||This is strictly for lovers of jazz...swing, latin, etc  There will be a show tomorrow the 26th December at Lords Club Maryland featuring, the Censers of Gold, JazzMind, Ayo Solanke to mention a few. The show starts 6pm prompt. Its NOT free. The tickets cost 1000 naira.

07-2-2006|m|I am a Bassist who loves Jazz, The guys that got me into jazz and music are very close friends of mine Femi Temowo and michael Olatuja. When it comes to Nigerian Jazz players in UK that are known to top musicians in the UK Scene These two guys are on the top of the list if not the top. You cannot compare these guys to lekan, akin or agbo and co thats an insult. These guys have played in Ronnie scotts, Northsea Jazz festival, Montreaux jazz festival, pizza express etc not to now talk of the big artist they've played with like George benson,miss dynamite, terry walker, amy winehouse, soweto. ...... infact just type in Michael olatuja or femi temowo on google's browser and let google do the talking also check out Soweto Kinch's album called "conversation with the unseen" I am not underestimating anyother nigerian jazz musician, but these guys are the top in UK jazz, well they are not known to many nigerians.
31-3-2005|m|What is the right age for marriage?  Is there a particular age at which you'd expect a lady or a man to be married? At what age should you start thinking about marriage? And at what age should you start panicking if you've not yet found the right man? If you say age doesn't matter, what are the things that matter and can they be measured?  Personally, I think the most important things to achieve before marriage are economic independence and a clear sense of where you're going in life. If you have that by 20, fire away. And if you're a lady, and you're close to or 30, please start panicking! Maybe you've been too picky?!
01-4-2005|m|The right age for marriage, I would say, is immediately after mental maturity, which is around the age of 18 for the male and around 16 for the female. Well there is a condition which is the ability to be able to take care of the wife and the family financially and morally, but then again we shouldn't forget the issue of education which might arise and conflict with the family needs in the aspect of being there and all that. So I would say the best time is after secondary school providing the requirement is fullfilled.Well frankly then again, actually its really a very difficult issue to really tackle because we do have different values, in terms of religious background and cultural values.  In my University, we do have Iranians that are married, and studying with their wives and infact they are happy and I can see that, because they are always hanging out with each other and the brightness of their face says it all. Most of this Iranian colleagues are only 19 to around 20, and frankly I am happy for them. Well if there is the money, I would say why not?
02-4-2005|f|Kazey has said it all really. I should simply buttress his point by saying there is no such thing as 'marriageable age'. As long as one is independent maturity wise (which in itself is a relative thing) and the financial means (without which the whole thing will be a joke) is readily available, then by all means, it's time to settle down. Having said that however, one needs to take into consideration the issue, I dare say the vital issue of raising kids. In my personal opinion, a lady who is younger than 20 might not necessarily be the best of mums to her kids largely because she is still so much a kid herself. Although there are women who are well over 30 and are still not the best mums. In any event, the 3 major factors I believe one needs to settle down will of course include a responsible and like minded man/woman (2) Maturity cum high sense of responsibility and last but not the least (3) financial independence. This does not exhaust the list by any chance but represent the basic things to look out for.  Erm.... Seun, I'm precariously closer to 30 than I am to 25 and I am not married. That is not to say that I've been too choosy or picky, it's just that the 2 relationships I've ever had didn't turn out too well. I've still got deep emotional scares from the last one and it's been over a year. Armed with such invisible wares, one tends to shrink away from these things till you find the right person. It takes time for you to know that, hence my seeing someone now for the last few months and trying to see if we are indeed compatible or not. Touching briefly again on financial independence, the erroneous and outdated belief that a guy must earn and save so much before he gets married is completely untrue. Couples who genuinely love each other remain helpmates and pool their earnings and resources together to meet the needs of the home.  Subjects as heavy as this are usually multifaceted, in that there are diverse sides of it for different people. The foregoing simply represents my personal view.
07-4-2005|f|Seun, I dont like discussing sensitive issues like this one, but I can't help correcting this statement: "if you're a lady, and you're close to or 30, please start panicking! Maybe you've been too picky?!"  I disagree with you brother, if you rush into marriage when you are not ready, you will rush out! I will be 30 by June 12, and for you information am not panicking, I'd better marry at 40 and live a happy life, than marry at 20 and stay unhappy for the rest of my life.  I have had experiences in relationships, both good and bad. We are in the modern age if you must know, and you don't go into marriage because society demands or because your mates are married. You marry because your are mentally, physically, financially, and most importantly emotionally ready.  The ripe age for a woman in my opinion is from 21. Take note: any woman who is desperate to get married will always end up with the wrong person. It's not an issue of being choosy or picky. Maybe some of us have had one or two unfortunate relationships, so we learn from our mistakes and they guide us in our future encounters. The essential thing is, 'marry your best friend'. I learnt that from AYA, so I will remain unmarried until I find my best friend, anything worth doing is worth doing well.  The reason for marriage in olden days was mostly so we can have children to help out in the farms, companionship then was secondary, a man can even marry more than one wife just to produce enough children. Now in the modern age, companionship (in my opinion, I stand to be corrected) is primary. To have children in our society, you have to be financially ready - so it's secondary.  Since the basic thing is companionship, and the economic situation coupled with cultural demands about marriage don't make things easy for couples ready for marriage to get married, it now make a lot of couples live together for ages, some even get children, before they now think of making their marriage official. Just like Ra said, the onus falls on both partners now. If you waiting for the ripe time, it might never come.  In essence what am saying is this: Nowadays we all enjoy companionship even if we are not married (boyfriend/girlfriend relationship, live-in lovers etc.) therefore marriage keeps getting postponed and delayed.
07-4-2005||Well, I guess I'm with angelgirl on her views. I think, for a guy sha, all things being equal you should marry between 26-29. Marrying at 30 or after it is just not cool. For girls I guess 21 up ain't bad. But as angelgirl said a whole lot of things have to be considered.
07-4-2005|m|Personally, I believe the right age for a man to marry is when: 1. He is financially able to take care of a family (not necessarily rich). 2. He is emotionally mature to play the role of a husband and a father.  As for the woman, the right age for her to marry, in my opinion is when: 1. She is has reached at least the age of 18 (to guard against VVF). 2. She has learned a trade or skill to avoid being a financial liabilty to her husband. 3. She has a ready suitor (which is the most important factor).
07-4-2005|f|Brother, whereabouts are you from? Forgive my French, but I couldn't help cracking my ribs when I read your She has learned a trade or skill to avoid being a financial liabilty to her husband.  I believe what you meant to say there was she must be independent career wise. Learning a trade or skill somehow reminded me of the days of my great grandparents when all the wives could do was limited to dyeing clothes, selling palm oil or farm produce and matting hair.
08-4-2005|m|Now the trend of the topic is changing. well first of all i would like to say that not everybody has to go to school and earn a certificate.  Everybody should go to school you might say? right? OK who would be my maid? a graduate from a university? who would be my butler or even mechanic? a university graduate.  when we tend to look, at the situation, its not the educational background nor even the millionaire achievement if you might call it that, that is really an important factor that needs to be sufficed before we can even take a glance at marriage. We said meeting the right guy? does time really justify that? Marrying our best friend? Trust me i have had best friends that have really disappointed me. But thats not the issue. The issue is the right age for marriage. But then again we say for the right age we have to have this , we have to have that. Then what really is primary? Maturity and financial stability? or even more?  And before i forget i would like to say happiness comes with scarifies and endurance, and its not natural. This applies to happiness in marriage too.
08-4-2005|m|Well, I am laughing too.  The point is, if a girl has to marry at the age of 18 or less, then she couldn't have achieved much career-wise. At best, she might has just finished her secondary school education.
08-4-2005|m|This is an interesting question, one that has been bothering me too.  I have read all contributions and they all make a lot of sence, but I still think the buttom line is "It is all relative to everybody". Right?
08-4-2005|f|As a lady I believe the right age for marriage is when I am independent cos I wouldn't want to be a liability. People need to mature and find themselves before finding someone else and one does not truly mature till their late 20s, or 30's.  One would really need to take their time and search for their soulmates. You know, you really have to find the bone of your bone and the flesh of your flesh. Remember, God took a rib from Adam to create the woman. So personally, I believe you must find your missing rib before going into marriage.  And then one important thing is the issue of finance. As Ra rightly said, one must be in a position to take good care of the family and at the same time one has to commit it into God's hands. HE KNOWS BEST.  So really there is no right age for marriage. You only have to consider it when you feel you are matured enough to endure all the pain, joy, sorrow, happiness and whatever that comes with marriage.
08-4-2005|m|I want to be sensitive, but this has to stop.  I do not agree with the idea that women should get married in their late 20s or early 30s. You make it sound as if when you feel you are ready you can just go to a supermarket and pick up a man. I don't think it can be that easy.  When you are in your early twenties, or even just above eighteen, there are lots of suitors: - Boys your age want to go out with you. - Men slightly older than you want to go out with you. - Single or divorced men much older than you want to go out with you!  So at this level the girl gets a lot of attention. This is the age at which the phrase "every girl has a suitor" is actually true.  When you are in your very late twenties or thirties, this is the case: - The 'good' men your age are engaged. Taken. - Men slightly older than you are married. - Men much older than you are 'old men' as far as you are concerned.  The few single men are still going to be dating women in their early twenties, as well as people closer to your age (I would)! And to make matters worse, your 'taste' would have improved, with all the extra education and work experience. This is when ladies start having serious doubts about whether it's "ok to date married men".  The point is this. If men are getting married at 25, women have to get married at 23. If men are getting married at 28, 29 then women have to get married at 24, 25. Because men will not date women who are older than them, but we would gladly date women who are much younger. As far as I know, the most eligible men get married earlier than the 'strugglers' and 'players' you are trying to avoid.  A lady should not prepare for marriage by 'waiting' for maturity. You should prepare for it by getting matured faster. Now exactly how is one to get matured faster? We'll have to the relationship experts, but I don't think it means burying yourself in a demanding career or field of study while your friends are dating and getting married!
08-4-2005||Hey Seun take it easy. You make it sound as if women are some unlucky people that have to always beg for marriage and that men are kings have the upper hand in selecting marriage partners. Yes I'm a guy and I love the fact that it's man's world, but you've gotta have pity and reason with the girls once in a while. As much as you enjoy your advantage when it comes to picking a partner you wouldn't want ur sister to suffer just to get married.  I got a sister a little younger than me, and I wouldn't want her to go through that. I also got two elder sisters both over 30. The younger is married with kids and the older not yet. What matters in life is being happy and impacting positively on others. if marriage fits this plan for u then goodluck. If not you can still enjoy your life.
08-4-2005|f|Seun take it easy on yourself boy. You got it all wrong. I only said one do not truly mature until they are in their 20s, 30s. I want you to read the last paragraph again ok? I know you always have a problem anytime the issue of relationship is being discussed. Don't worry it's only a matter of time.
08-4-2005|f|Thank you trae, u said it all
11-4-2005|m|Tayotina, you're right!  I get a little excited when relationships are being discussed. The thing is, all I was trying to say is that being a woman is more of being a pop star than being a man is. One day people can't get enough of you and you think you are in control of them. But once the next cool thing comes along they look past you and you realise you were not as much in control of their hearts as you thought.  Having said that, I will try to refrain from discussing issues I haven't experienced.
22-4-2005|f|It depends on so many things mostly maturity both physically, emotionally, psychologically, financially, healthwise, spiritually etc. Marraige is something you can rush in but can't rush out, so you have to be very careful. I can say there is a right age for marriage because if I should say maybe 24, some culture will query that so it depends on the parties involved.  But in all things, we shouldn't be forgetting someone that is very crucial i.e. talking to Our Heavenly Father about everything even about what age we should go into marriage (I mean individually asking Him).
23-4-2005|m|The right age for marriage is when a person has found the right person to marry. Marriage is a beautiful experience with the right partner, regardless of the age one enters into it. Ikpa
24-4-2005|m|Ikpa, I like your angle.  But I think we should bear it in mind that who you are at age 18 is not necessarily who you are at age 25 or 32. Over time, people change. Sometimes with age a person may get more mature, or become an angry and untrusting person over some bitter experiences.
29-4-2005|m|Seun all of you have left out one thing. agreed by the time a girl is 26 going on 30 she is supposed to be independent. But culture also determines marriageable age especially when you have a mother with hopes of becoming a grandmother earlier than her mates.  Women are expected to marry young in our culture (because we place a high premium on childbearing).  I believe you should marry when you are financially independent and mentally mature. Age is not the only factor , emotional issues also come into play (However for some of us who don't believe in the existence of love, that may not really be a factor.)
29-4-2005|f|It's quite unfortunate that you feel that way kodewrita; a world void of love is indeed a world empty of hope.
04-5-2005|m|I;ll keep it nice and simple for a guy (target for myself) is 28 and with girls i think 26 sounds just about right
23-5-2005|m|I will rather say one can marry at the age of 20 provided you satisfy the three conditions. 1) you must be physically mature. 2) you must be financially mature. 3) you must be spiritually mature. If you haven't developed the secondary structures no matter the age you attain you can't go into marriage. If you can't feed urself talkless of the family, you can't go into marriage if you do it will crash. If you're not spiritually mature how will you know what is the will of god for you in marriage and how to apply wisdom and principles God put in place for a blissful home. Please be wise. Shine your eyes.
23-5-2005||Seems the answers here are just spawning more questions for me.  For example, most people are saying "marry when {emotionally or spiritually or mentally or physically or <insert your own category here} mature". What do you mean by "mature"?  Anyhow, I think it's silly for anyone to turn marriage (which should be undertaken with the greatest care in the world) into a do-or-die affair by imposing artificial time limits and decreeing a 'suitable' age for marriage.  It's when someone is told that they should get married before they are 30 that they jump into marriage with a totally unsuitable person because they are 29 years 364 days and desperate. And as someone who has seen a fair few desperately unhappy marriages, I'd rather remain single than enter into such living hells.
24-5-2005||I'm amused by marriage, seeing as my girlfriend just got married. I'm not sure what she was expecting, but there is no going back. I guess there is this perception where people think their partners will complete them. lol! Na lie~ I saw a TV program where the individual was told, u've got to feel whole first, so that when you enter something like marriage its about sharing. People, be true to yourselves. Feeling whole doesn't always have to be about making sure you have a secure bank account, or you are the right weight or you have a degree. It may apply to some, but sometimes its the simplest emotions liking finally knowing who you are and being content to let things flow. I do not believe you can place that in an age bracket. Placing culture in the equation is when things generally turn sour ( from what I've seen), but thats life.
24-5-2005|f|well, i think 12 sha...it's pretty normal in ma village...
02-6-2005|m|In Nigeria today the right age for a woman to get married is at most 25 and for men you might evevn decide not to marry till you are 40years na you Sabi
03-6-2005|f|10,12,15,18,22,40,58, whatever as long as she has breasts and she has started menstruating, what stops her from getting married? But all the brothers they like to get established and up and going before getting married so I've said my piece.  Chikena!
04-6-2005|f|quite funny really!
04-6-2005|f|Funny? The humour was lost on me but 'barbaric' was the word that came to mind.
23-6-2005|m|The right age for Marriage is when you can support the family financially
06-7-2005|m|At the age of 20 for Ladies and 22 for Man.(My suggestion)
31-3-2005|m|BBC News "Lagos is the biggest city in Nigeria and sub-Saharan Africa, but until recently it did not even have any cinemas. That is all the more surprising given that Nigerians love watching films: the country is famous for its thriving and expanding home-video industry. Now, however, that has all changed, thanks to the Silverbird Cinemas."  Jitendra Sharma: "Never ever have I heard opening of a cinema hall or a cineplex make so much news! The launch of the cineplex took almost everyone concerned with cinema in Nigeria by surprise ..."  Patricia at the Mobile Nigeria Forum: "Any one been to the Siverbird Galleria? Nice place to watch a movie, very large screen, high quality pictures and sound system with the smell of pop corn all around you. I went there to watch "National Treasure" and I enjoyed it very much; as against watching a pirated CD at home. You guys should give it a trial (not that I am advertising for them). It is a really cool place to relax."  What do you think of the Silverbird Cinemas? Have you been there?
02-5-2005|m|I have been there once and I think its a nice place but they should work on the price, because I personally will say I am a film addict and I can't be paying 1500k every movie but its a nice place to relax and unwind.
02-5-2005|m|The official website of Silverbird Cinemas, which (I think) is part of Silverbird Galleria, is: 
06-5-2005|f|Looks like Siverbird Television is advertising both for Siverbird Cinemas and the VCD vendors on the street. I see them sell all the movies advertised to be shown at the cinemas everywhere in Lagos.
11-5-2005|m|I feel what trish feels, too. I actually look out for Silverbird adverts before I make my choice in going for movies. Funny. Well, I check out some ratings too. Anyhow, the cinema idea is a cool one. I really hope it lasts.
20-5-2005|m|Seun, e be like say you get bad bele with Silverbird Cinemas. Chill out, go out there one weekend and enjoy a day full of fun. I spend most of my naira there. You want to go with me?
20-5-2005|m|Chawkee, I don't think it's obvious from what I wrote above, but since I am not a student I will have to pay 1,500 or so to watch a movie. I feel that this is too expensive.  To add insult to injury, I will have to take public transport to the Cinema venue and back home after watching the movie! I mean, I want to watch movies legally from the confort of my home, and at an affordable price.
01-6-2005|f|Seun make I give you advice:  If it is too expensive as you say it is (I don't know because I haven't even smelt the place yet) then ask any always updated CD shop near you and buy 20 naira popcorn in your area, get a chilled bottle of coke (it could be two if the film is so long) and watch the movie. God I bet you will enjoy it more than I do.  Catch ya
01-6-2005|m|I'm doing just that at the moment. Watching Star Wars Episode 3, 'the Revenge of the Sith' on my PC and enjoying every moment!  Too bad I can't boast of having a legal copy. The people behind Silverbird Cinemas are doing what they're doing legally, and that's probably why it's so expensive.
01-6-2005|f|Yes you are right but sometimes you have to do what is wrong to do what is right, just as Nicholas Cage said in National Treasure. Anyway what is happening now in the film? (I am dying 2 watch it).
20-6-2005||Its terrible that the ONLY films they show there are American. American cinemas show American films, chinese cinemas show chinese films, yet we think it serves us to completely ignore the creative skills of filmmakers at home and make the already full pockets of American film companies, actors, and directors even fatter. Its ok to have SOME American films, but that seems to be all that they show. I don't know when it will be possible for Nigerian films to be shown, but hopefully it will be soon....
20-6-2005|m|Perhaps they are showing these films because people want to watch them
20-6-2005|f|i believe it will be shown soon, but then..lets think of it.. u know most of the nigerian films out now re majorly craps, so why would silverbird show craps at a high price, menn they will be tarnishing their image o! but if good movies come in succession (naija movies) it will be shown someday
21-6-2005|m|Actually most countries in the world show American films!! Simply becuase they tend to be better quality, even in the UK most films are American.  So it is not just Naija that this happens, when our home based products get to an acceptable quality they will be shown.  In China that you mentioned they also show American films a lot and vice versa.  I wrote a review on SilverBird earlier this year, let me go and find it and post it here.
21-6-2005|m|Silverbird  I visited the cinema complex known as Silverbird while in Naija and I have to give credit where credit is due.  The place is a nice joint and cannot be knocked.  The actual building is well lit and airy and is as good as any UCI complex in London and actually better than a few!!  The actual theatres themselves were upto standard and very clean, I watched two movies while in Lagos, Elektra and National Treasure.  The video and sound quality was very good and comparable to most local cinemas in Jand but nowhere near THX quality or DTS which you will get from the best cinema's in the UK, but i am sure that is only a matter of time.  The popcorn to me was the biggest surprise of all!! It was better than ANY i have EVER had, and that covers both the UK and the US!!!  I could go just for the popcorn alone!  Another big plus for Silverbird is that in the complex is a joint called Cubes which is like a bar where people can hang out and dance, while very pricey it was a classy joint.  I give Silverbird a classy 8/10
21-6-2005||Most Bollywood films aren't exactly top notch either .
22-6-2005|m|true, but they are now producing a few gems that are being shown worldwide and even considered for Oscars, and no matter how crap the storylines thier production values are 1000% better than the Naija movies!!
22-6-2005|f|So there are now movies (cinemas) in 9ja. Why in hell would u pay 1500 naira to see a movie?? it's just 7 dollars here. (oh almost d same i guess). But anyways, i like the idea. I WANNA GO TO 9JA.
22-6-2005|m|$7!!!  boy I dey move go yankee o!  In jand the normal price is now about 6.50 and if it is the westend then nothing less than 10!!!

23-11-2005|m|I am a new member, and believe Silverbird had done a great deal by establishing a world class cinema in Nigeria. I wish more in your plans for better things. Please do always include Nigerian home video in your film schedule. Thanks
23-11-2005|m|Please do endeavour to slash the price a movie from the 1,500 to 1,000 and the 500 naira for the student can still remains. To the management of silverbird cinema. Thanks
04-12-2005|f|i think the prices are a bit high compared to the ones down here
08-12-2005|m|wen i went to nigeria earlier this yr i visited silver n to b honest i actually like wat i saw.
08-1-2006|m|a lot of people said the cinema is international standard. Good job! but i think it shouldn't be in only one city in nigeria. do u have to travel all the way from Ibadan / Abuja to watch movies? or is there more than one yet?
10-2-2006|f|i guess the price is kinda high. guess the money conversation is the problem. But when you convert it to dollars, it is about the same price over here. i
11-2-2006|f|I think Silverbird Cinema, being the main or only cinema in Nigeria, should show Nigerian movies, however bad they may be. They can help to improve the quality.  I've never visited because I live on the mainland and VI is far - the last time I was in VI, I spent 2 hours in the traffic jam going and 4 hours coming back. It is usually a whole day's affair so I can't go there just to watch a film. My neighbor went there sometime ago with his kids (they watched Shark Tale). He spent so much time in the traffic jam to and fro and had to spend a lot of money buying the kids snacks on the way. He said it was a great place but he wouldn't go through all that stress to watch a movie again.  I watched Shark Tale sometime later in my house and had the luxury of going back whenever I missed something.  Silverbird is a great place for those who live near or happen to be in the area, but for those who live far, I think it isn't worth the time and expenses. Once silverbird starts advertising/showing a film, u can be sure it is already on sale. So u can try buying the film and watching it in the comfort of your home instead: film- 300, popcorn- 30, coke- 120; total- 450.
31-5-2006|m|Silverbird isn't the only cinema in Nigeria and this should answer your question  'Its wrong to think that Silverbird Cinema is all about foreign movies' Saturday, May 27, 2006  Established two years ago, the Sliverbird Cinema has proved to be a centre of movie excellence. It has succeeded in reviving the cinema culture in Lagos.  it has even gone further than this. Now, a movie buff can sit relaxedly and enjoy his favourite flick in a comfortable environment, with his wife and children in tow. How has it been in the last two years? Blockbuster spoke with Mr Jide Azumah, General Manager, Silverbird Galleria. Excerpts:  It has been a very long road in the last two years because there was no precedent. We had to set a precedent to match our own standard. We made sure from day one that we were not guided by the so-called Nigerian standard. The impression we are trying to create in this country is for people to get value for their money like when they visit a place like this in any part of the world.  Bold moves  The history of Silverbird is replete with bold moves. Silverbird has a track record of working in uncharted waters. When we started 25 years ago with music promotion we were told that we wanted to do what nobody had done before. As young boys, we all grew up going to the cinema. We still have fond memories of the cinema. Now, it is a big shame that the only time we can enjoy good movies is when we travel outside Nigeria. For this reason, my chairman (Ben Bruce) decided to bring back the cinema culture. Today, there is a place a family can go for relaxation and that is the Silverbird Cinema. We have created an environment that we used to enjoy when we were growing up.  Silverbird Cinema and foreign movies  It is wrong for people to think that Silverbird Cinema is all about foreign movies. We are a 35mm cinema exhibition outfit. Nollywood does not shoot movies on celluloid. But what we have done is to invest on digital projectors to accommodate Nollywood movies that are converted to DVDs. Now, I am glad that a movie has just been produced on celluloid in Nigeria. It is entitled Amazing Grace. We are looking forward to exhibiting the film.  Challenges  The number one challenge is that we have done what nobody has done. So, we had to set the pace. The fact that people are not used to this is also a problem. It is quite demanding to train people. But I am very proud that we are the first service company fully in the hands of Nigerians. This I believe is an achievement. It is very challenging to get people to act properly within an environment such as this.  Management style  It is simple. My style is leadership by example. There is nothing I ask my staff to do that I cannot do. I am here 18 hrs a day almost throughout the week. When I get to the office at 6.30am, I may not leave until 10 or 11pm. My staff is also committed. It is not just telling people to do it but showing them how to do it.  Motivation  Success motivates me. They say nothing succeeds like success. I must excel in everything that I do. Failure is an anathema. It doesnt exist in my dictionary. I thank God that today I have succeeded in all the tasks placed before me.  Expansion plans  We are building a Galleria in Abuja. We now have two centres. Within the next 2 years we will be in Bayelsa, Port Harcourt and precisely in Ikeja, Lagos.  Source- 
04-8-2006|m|1500 naira is simply to high a price for a Nigerian cinema. Some of you peeps can afford it and I aint hating on y'all. However not many Nigerians can afford to spend that kind of money to watch a movie. Hence the influx of pirated copies into the area. Videoclubs are still available. I wonder if the cinema is ever full. I see folks here mentioning WestEnd and Co.Yet I doubt if many of you ACTUALLY work in London and spend 7 to 10 pounds on a movie often.Great to know there's finally a cinema back at home but it's too damn expensive. I live in Poland, Central Europe and students pay $3.50 to see a movie.Anyways enjoy my brothers and sisters
04-8-2006|m|omolomo, Silverbird also do a students discount as well.  And to be honest for working people 1,500 is nothing. Shebi Lagos is one of the most expensive cities in the world.  Also the westend is not 7 o! That is only during non-peak times, if you want to watch proper westend movie in the evening it is around 10.  It is not as if na everyday person dey go now.
22-8-2006||u all are complaining about the cost of watching a movie.see i got the ans GO MAKE URS.
23-8-2006|m|the answer is when many cinema houses open the prize will come down. stop criticizing silverbird their doing their best it's hard to do biz in naija
01-4-2005|f|Stress: the No 1 mental and physical drainer.Stress brings insomnia (difficulty in getting to sleep, getting up in the middle of the night, or having disturbed sleep). Here are some tips to help you sleep: 1. Go to sleep when you are tired not necessarily when it is the usual time for bed. 2. If you cannot sleep, take a walk in your neighbourhood (that is if its safe, okay?), or read a book, get fresh air in your backyard. 3. Do gentle muscle-stretching exercises in your bedroom. 4. Do not go to bed with a grudge. Sort out what needs sorting out and make peace with your friends, partner, children as the case may be.( tough one huh?). 5. Avoid over loading your stomach just before going to bed, eat meals early and choose what you eat wisely. proteins make better bedtime foods than carbohydrates. 6. Have a cold shower before going to bed.  These are just some tips, please feel free to add some more tips on the subject I.e coping with stress
02-4-2005|f|After the cold shower take a warm glass of milk and if u live in the tropics, spray ur room!
02-4-2005|m|delarontus,  What you've posted is more of a general stress tip. My stress tips are: - Work towards independence from domineering people in your life. - Be more organized. It pays of on the long run. - Remember that stress is not about having too much to do; it's about not being in control.  Seun
05-4-2005|f|hey guys since we r all given tips well tis what i do to release stress. after a days work from college i mean, i just grap my favourite food, either i sit in front of the tele and pop in my favourite movie. or i just relax to the soothing sound of music!!!! i just can not live without it!! but the best way and day for me to relax is during rainny days, i just cuddle with a really good absorbing book, on my bed or somewhere cosy, remember it is a cooling weather and u just have like a hot chocolate milk wif u. or u just relax to the sound of a light music.. now tht is d way to relax well for me at least!!  it's all bout book n MUSIC!!
13-4-2005|f|Other ways to cope with stress include:  1.Regular exercise: Yes, we should find time to incorporate exercise into our busy schedule. Some people are of the notion that only over-weight people need exercise, this is wrong. Regular exercise makes you keep fit and believe me reduces your chances of having High blood pressure.  2. Massage: This is used to relieve pain, a good massage helps to release accumulated tension.  3. Meditation: This is used to induce physical and mental relaxation by creating a peaceful state of mind. You can take two hours of doing absolutely 'nothing' just relax and let your mind drift as much as it wants over happy memories.  4. Breathing: Exhalation and inhalation also helps to calm your nerves.
13-4-2005|f|I'm afraid I have to second Chigszy's stand. There are different ways of relaxing and working out stress for different people. There are no methods grafted in stone. I, for one, shut out the world and its ample stress by getting myself a really good novel. I'm a drifter, you see, and often find it easy planting myself at some beautiful scene or the other in my book. I love sitting down to well plotted movies as well. At the end of a meal (whatever catches my fancy at the time) with a novel in hand and lovely soulful music in the background (e.g Tunde Baiyewu's new album or Lighthouse Family), I can not be pinned down by stress of whatever nature.  For some, lying down in a bath of steaming scented water for ages is a sure way of relaxation. I haven't actually tried that but I'm bound to find it as sure a way of easing off tension (particularly from work!) and coming out wide awake and alert.  But..... that's me and those are my methods. To each, as they say, his own........
13-4-2005|m|Ra, I understand that you agree with Chigzy's tips but why do you have to be "afraid" to second it?
13-4-2005|f|Simply because it appears quite contrary to more popular opinion of massages, deep meditation (Yoga), getting enough rest and other universally accepted ways of 'killing' stress, all of which are by no means less effective.
05-7-2005|f|A little stress is a good thing. It keeps us on our toes and busy pursuing our dreams. However, our bodies were never designed to handle the formidable amount of stress we face in todays complicated world. Unless we deal with it wisely, it will rob us of our health and our happiness. The best way to deal with stress is to beat it before it begins to beat you. Develop healthy habits in diet, sleep, and exercise. Invest the time it takes to build healthy relationships. Recognize God's sovereignty over your life.  "Distress" is most often stress that hasn't been addressed.

02-4-2005|f|Necessary Evil Well, there's no other way to put it than the obvious... I love shopping. It does not help matters that my cousin and I are age mates, live together and have the same dress sense, more or less. We go shopping practically every weekend unless of cos when were broke. Just this morning, we were talking about how we shop too much. But then again, it's something that can't be avoided, is it ? Does anyone feel me on this topic? Especially ladies. You've been invited, yet again, to an outing and all of a sudden there appears to be nothing suitable in your chukka blocked wardrobe. How can you not shop for something new to wear? Weddings are gonna start happening right, left and centre this time of year and let's just say it's a punishable offence to wear that wonderful dress everyone was drooling over at Tayo's wedding last year to Kunle's wedding this October. Why... if they drooled over it last year, they'll remember it this year...  It's pathetic really and wrecks havoc on one's bank account to say the least, but if you know a way out of it, I'm happy to hear you out.  Ooops, reading that for editing purposes, I must say it sounds a bit vain.... That's the wrongest picture, I'm everything but vain..... well...... not really.
02-4-2005|m|There was a time I used to get a copy of the Tuesday Guardian newspaper every week, just to know what computer-related gadgets are available and at what price. After a few months, I realised that it was a waste of time - I didn't really have the cash to finance this expensive form of shopping! I'm ready to resume the habit tommorrow if I'm spending someone else's money!  Ra: I don't feel the same way about shopping for clothes, though. I guess it's a ladies' thing. I don't understand why ladies think it's fun to try on various clothes, but I guess they won't understand why I think it's fun to play with the latest computer-related gadgets.
02-4-2005|f|I love shopping in whatever form, online shopping, window shopping or just sitting down and discussing shopping. But this year, i'm getting my finances right and thinking in the right direction not to buy everything on impulse. It just leaves u broke and desperate for more money.
05-4-2005|m|Well, I love shopping when I have free money to spend, especially whenever I travelled outside the country for official duties. I will visit clothes and bodywares shops to buy some cool stuff for me and my family. And also electronics and computer shops for the latest gadgets.
12-4-2005||yeah seun shopping is a ladies thing. and when u all go running ur mouth about shopping remember we got many poor folks out there who ain't got more than two clothing wears...give to charity today  affluence...God knows a poor man would be tempting to pick up a gun and rob after going through ovation magazine and seeing the life style of the rich and famous
12-4-2005|m|Trae, it is in the interest of the common man for the very rich to "waste" their money buying unnecessary things. Or else there's no way the rest of us would catch up! Those who provide "premium" services to the rich are wealth redistribution agents.
13-4-2005|f|You accurately hit the nail on the head with your last post. Without redistribution of wealth, however seemingly ineffective, the ordinary man on the street will be without hope and no assurance of something as basic as feeding. Instances abound and are too numerous to note. But for the sake of this argument; without people who are ready to add credit to their phones everyday, what happens to the young man on the road all day hawking his scratch cards?
02-5-2005|f|I like to bargain shop--finding a good deal makes me so excited. The worst part though is that I end up buying things I don't yet need, just because it's a great deal. I'm convinced, however, that one day my thriftiness (if it can be called that) will be worth it.  I love window shopping and trying things on, even if I can't afford it at the moment. And yes, I often have the situation where I am going to a fancy party or something I'm really looking forward to and there is nothing in my closet that would work (which I guess is a bit of a lie).  For the past few years now I have been donating clothing I don't like/wear to charities. That way I feel good when I buy new stuff!
02-5-2005|m|Well...since it seems that we have so many rich people in this forum, will somebody please extend the good "Samaritan" attitude this way?  I can send Bank Account number anytime.  But for real..shopping is very feminine, and except on few occasions(Back to Schools) I can't remember leaving my house to go buy shirts(Not recently anyhow), it's not as if I don't have the money oo, but I would rather that My Madam do it than wasting all those preciuos time wrangling with one man over what color or what price..more so, I think Madam knows what fit me more than I personally do.
03-5-2005|m|Well, to me shopping is really great. I do really love it. I could buy anything but I really prefer clothes and shoes.
24-5-2005|f|aite...4 me...i'm a freak 4 fashion....esp. shoes...ma gawd! u shld see me when i'm packin' outta ma dorm afta d semester....lol! it's crazy! but mehn! i luv it jare! it's just one of d things dt make me feel like a gurl, y'know mehn, ma boo or husband just has 2 live wit it...no jokes!
22-6-2005|f|Oh trust me, you ain't the only only crazy about shopping. I make sure new outfit every weekend. It's something my dad is used to. I can't picture myself not shopping for something, mostly outfit and shoes. To me, it's something every girl must do. Guys can stay without doing that, but not girls.
31-10-2005|f|I love shopping too, I work in clothing store so most of my pay check go to clothes. I can't stop, most of my clothe still have tag on it, my co-workers even try to help me to stop buying clothe for just two week, but it didn't work. what can I say I love clothes
31-10-2005|f|@ Icingbaby, i feel ya. dat's y i don't work in dem shoppin stores, i'll just ask the manager to keep my pay cos they always have something new comin in and once i see it, i'll get it. Shopping is mostly a female thing, kinda like in our blood. it dosen't help for me when my mum's a shopaholic, cos when we both go to the mall, we don't leave anywayz, i got skool stuff to worry about now, so i kinda cut down on them sprees.
24-4-2007|f|god i use to love shoppin it was like an addiction, i would travel from one country to another just to buy things .men it was dat bad.I had to slow down when i found out dat it was becomin an addiction .
26-4-2007|f|u r a girl arent u
14-5-2007|m|I used to be addicted to technology window-shopping, but I stopped when I noticed that I had no money to buy those things. Even now, I'm yet to be reinfected the 'addiction'.
17-5-2007|m|if you love shopping so much, then prepare to finish all ya money.  Online shopping is taking a whole new dimension now. for all ma peoples in naija, you can now shop online, finish all the money in your bank accounts via your ATM card and have everything delivered to your home by tnt international (www.tnt.com) If you don't have an ATM card, you can pay cash directly at the bank (so much stress anyway!)  All you need to do is:   we dey wait una oh!
17-5-2007|m|@kachi Face,  I just felt like spending a bundle of money to buy some cute clothing and lingerie for my baby, now that you told me where to find it. Unfortunately, all I'm getting from your website is: No results for "Women's Clothing"! Maybe you should try a little bit harder before rattling the cage.
17-5-2007|m|i'm a software junkie.  i spend over two hours a day downloading application updates, pirated music, pirated applications, ebooks. . . i'm running out of hard disk space !!!!  i got over 40gb of music, and i havent listened to half of it. i have at least six game CDs i haven't played.and a lot of the software just sits on my hard drive. . .
17-5-2007|m|i think pips who are addictd to shopping (especially cloths and shoes) hav to much moni and too lil work to do. Go n get a life!
17-5-2007||I like freebies
17-5-2007|m|i like freebies too
17-5-2007|f|aww mehn i love shopping, even at 12 midnight, i get the shopping itch , i go to walmart not really needing anything, last time i went to walmart, i ended up redecorating my bathroom. . i cant go to a club without getting a new outfit everytime cause i believe if i wear the a used outfit, i wont have fun. wierd! closet space is now a huge problem
18-5-2007|m|Who does not like shopping, but when we begin to treat it as a disease that we cannot cure, then that is where I have problem. I see people who complain of being addicted to shopping as spoilt brats. Simply solution is to give your money to charity or go to Darfur, Sudan. This is an affluent lifestyle that is mired in consumerism. I want to have it all attitude
18-5-2007||Yeah. Shopping Is One Of The Most Expensive Hobbies. Its Mo Expensive Than Golf And Polo. Put Together.  I Hope U Have The Money To Keep Up With It.  I'm Thinking Of Starting A Shoppers Club.  The QUEEN Would Be the Patron. Al Fayed Of Would Be My First Catch  Prince Charles Would Be Denied Membership, bla, bla, bla
18-5-2007||Are There Any Psychologists or Research Students On This Forum.?  This Would Be A Good Topic For Research. The Internet Being A Disruptive Technology Has Created Platforms For New Business Models And Even A New Form Of Madness.  I Swear CyberCraze, CyberMadness, E-Madness, E-Craze, CyberPsycho etc are All Realities Of This Digital Age. I Think We Need Specialists For This Emerging Field.  Im Thinking Of Developing An Application Called Cyber_Asylum.  So That We Can House All This System_Addicts For Rehab.
18-5-2007|m|Shopping my foot. If a guy is fully loaded, it kinds of add to the ego of the lady he takes out for shopping o. That's cool sha but i bet its bettr prevented from being an addiction 'cos when you sell those things back, the ydont worth, a third of th initial costs
18-5-2007|f|@topic Pisses me off!
18-5-2007|f|Ra i feel u my sister o, i ve got the same vice,cant stop shopping, was just telling a colleague today that shopping is the only therapy to whatever problems i have. if i am feeling sad, depressed,bored or happy all i need to put things right is a bit of shopping theraphy. Then i cant resist a bargain, if something is on sale, i buy it whether its my size or not, may come in handy someday. Any e go BETTER.

18-5-2007||good for you.
02-4-2005|m|Hello,  Malaria is a well understood disease. We know that it is spread by mosquitos. Mosquitos are well understood insects. We know they spread by breeding in stagnant pools of water. So, why do so many people keep falling victim to it every year?  - We don't often clear the puddles in our compounds. - We don't always use insecticides to clear our rooms of mosquitos. - We don't use mosquito nets and insect repellants as diligently as we should. - Some people don't believe in taking drugs until the fever is fully blown.  Let's just be more vigilant and malaria will be under control!  Seun
03-4-2005|f|That's very well said and will definitely reduce the risk of malaria but if you do all of that to your compound and within your immediate environment, how about the next compound? How about the million and one places we always have the need to visit?  There'll always be one stagnant water somewhere unattended by anyone and mosquitoes will continue to breed there. We have to face it really, we're in Africa and a long way away from a malaria free environment, crave it as we may.
03-4-2005|m|Ra: That is an insightful reply, but bear it in mind that: [list] [li]Mosquitos cannot transmit the malaria parasite until they are infected by someone suffering from malaria. If more people start treating malaria quickly and decisively (before the full fever breaks out) the chance of a random mosquito bite resulting in malaria will be much lower.[/li] [li]Mosquitos are usually inactive during the day. They come out during the evening, when most people are in their own houses. If your immediate environment is mosquito-free, you are much less likely to get bitten by mosquitos. So if you regularly spray each room in your house with an insecticide, use mosquito nets on all windows, and clear all water puddles in your compound, it will make a lot of difference![/li] [li]Nobody will challenge you if you decide to go one step further and clear stagnant pools of water on public property outside your compound (for example, roadside gutters close to your house). There are cheap chemicals you can pour into puddles to make it difficult for mosquito larvae to survive in them.[/li] [/list]  You'll be surprised how easily well-understood diseases (like malaria) can be reduced to insignificance when people take collective action against them!
24-5-2005||people will continue to suffer from malaria if our environment is kept dirty and un healthy for human living.  when there are stangnant water all around us, no proper arrangment for sanitory officers to check our surroundings as it use to be in time past,  sanitation is not been observered, people don't go for check up until alam blows up. There should be a public talk on how best to keep our surrounding free from dirts and jams.
24-5-2005|m|I have this application on my smartphone that repels mosquitos, it's called mosquitonet. This app really works, all you have to do is install the .sis file on your phone and launch it, your phone emits an inaudible high frequency sound that scares off those suckers.....
24-5-2005|m|Mamba, I can see from your diagram that a 20Hz tone scare away dragonflies and a 50-90KHz sound scares away bats. What frequency range scares away mosquitos?  I find this idea very interesting. Does it mean that if I play the same frequency on my PC speaker my computer room will be mosquito-free? Wow!
25-5-2005|f|Very funny mamba How on earth can that repel mosquitoes? In some environments, your battery will run out before daybreak! The poverty level makes that an almost impossible option because most people don't have mobile phones and some of those who do can't afford that hi-tech phone of yours.
25-5-2005|m|The point is clean environment. We can't eradicate mosquitoes paticularly in tropical region like ours but clean environment could breed new form of mosquitoes less dangerous to health.
26-5-2005|f|Mosquitoes are pests and will always spread malaria. That is their mission on earth.
26-5-2005|m|Seriously?  Or it is just a joke?
10-6-2005|f|I think we suffer from malaria because we have refused to take precautions! Maintain a clean environment. Use insecticides to protect against the mosquitoes that can come from neighbours and once the symptom of malaria is noticed, take any anti-malarial drug. Prevention is better than cure you know!
13-6-2005|m|The assumption is that when people have fever they have malaria, right? Many ended being treated for malaria, when in actual sense it was something else. Do not get me wrong, malaria is endemic in Nigeria, and preventive steps should be taken to CONTROL it. People will always suffer from the illness.
16-6-2005|m|I just wish we had as many hospital as churches, or as many school as churches. Then most of these problems like malaria would be solved
05-7-2005|f|WOW mamba you must be R.I.C.H
05-7-2005|m|naa, not really.  That phone is a Sonyericsson P910i, probably the best pda phone in the market for now.  I used the app when I was in Akure doing some repair job in our factory @ night. That place was filled with mosquitos and the app actually worked & doesn't drain the battery.....
14-7-2005|f|Still on the issue of malaria but marrying it to the disheartening issue of fake drugs in Nigeria, did you know that some people who travel back home to Nigeria are plagued by malaria? This in itself is not unusual, the immune system shuts down over the years and such people are more susceptible to the malaria parasite.  What I find terribly sad however, is the fact that some of these people go to the pharmacists and procure anti-malaria drugs with their own money only to find out when it's far too late that such drugs were fake. I know of at least 3 unfortunate people who died last year as a result of that. Malaria patients are quarantined here, as I imagine in most other western countries and we were not allowed to even visit this poor girl. She died a month later and was discovered at her inquest that she must have taken a heavy dose of fake drugs.  May God help us in this our Nigeria, may God help us all.
14-7-2005|m|Malaria is a disease of the tropics. It is good though to take these precausions you highlighted above. but you people left two things untouched these are ignorance (illiteracy) and poverty. It might surprise you to mention these two things and wonder how?  Some people are not enlightened and I think public awareness is essential. Awareness about the causes, consequences, prevention and treatment of Malaria is a neccessity. Our government can not do it alone, Health organisations, NGOs, Corporate organisations and individuals should be involved.  Our government tried about in the past by the programe called "Roll back malaria" The jingle was all over. But not enough.  Poverty, our government is not doing much about this.
20-7-2005|f|Well, when i tell my friend here that i had malaria, all they say is i almost died right? They don't get it that they can just use antibiotics and be cured. they think malaria is one big thing. I got malaria in NIgeria, I used antibiotics and i was okay.  Malaria can be stopped, if people start cleaning their enviroment and all "pure waters", should be really pure
27-7-2005|f|I do agree with Hot Angel.Malaria is caused by mosquitoes and mosquitoes develop as a result of dirt. so pls clean up your gutters and may be boil water before drinking or get a dispenser just be clean and keep the environment clean. Getting malaria here is a big diseases but in Nigeria is a common thing,people die from it all the time ,lets all come together and keep Nigeria clean so we can fight malaria.
28-7-2005|m|From: Latoya: "...and may be boil water before drinking or get a dispenser just be clean " and Hot-angel:"..and all "pure waters", should be really pure"  Fine, good to have clean and safe water, but what has that got to do with malaria?
28-7-2005|f|Clean water, won't bring mosquitoes. No mosquitoes, no malaria. Duhhh
28-7-2005|f|Malaria is basically caused by a bacteria carried by mosquitoes.Mosquitoes arrive as a result of dirt and unclean enviroments and things we eat and drink especially water,because we r meant to drink around 8-10 glasses a day can be infected. Cant you see the link Imnakoya
28-7-2005|f|Latoya,[b] we [/b]don't drink 8-10 glasses a day. We are meant to do that, but majoritity don't.
28-7-2005|f|Majorities don't. but all the same water is the fastest link to get malaria believe it or not
29-7-2005|m|Latoya! You can not get malaria from drinking water; you get it when an infected mosquito bites you.  Where did you get such an idea?
29-7-2005|f|Hey seun, i think you shuld read from the start before you try conclude.. malaria is caused by mosquitoes agreed... how do you get mosquitoes From stagnant water,wet places and all that. please go back and read again  "Malaria is basically caused by a bacteria carried by mosquitoes.Mosquitoes arrive as a result of dirt and unclean enviroments and things we eat and drink especially water,because we r meant to drink around 8-10 glasses a day can be infected"
29-7-2005|m|Layota et all, can you do some research into this topic please? I think every Nigerian should know the basic things about Malaria. The only relevance of water to Malaria is that, like you said, bredding of mosquito. That's all; drinking "dirty water" does not lead to Malaria. So Seun is right.  Secondly the organisms that cause Malaria is not bacteria, ....find out.
30-7-2005|f|Oh well i still stand on my points until i do some reasearch
21-11-2005|f|because of mosquito bites
23-11-2005|f|A new fungus has been discovered which can infect mosquitoes and prevent them from lusting after human blood. As you all know only female mosquitoes suck blood because they need it for their eggs. There is respite in the near future though the fungus still has to undergo several research and approvals by the international community before it can be used.
01-12-2005|m|Yah malaria is such a treatable disease It is sad that so many people die of a treetable disease.  When las i came to naija i did not take the anti-viral drug and i got really sick i had to be injected several times with chlorclean...and you know where they inject the needle  Their is a Chinese herb that can easily treat this disease  And malaria is not just an african disease. Remember that it is one of the oldest viruses... It has been around before man even roamed this great  What Africa is not the only place on the earth with stagnate water...did you know that in parts of china it is unsafe to drink well water...see it is the awareness that is the problem... Make Naija by dis drug/herb oh, God knows the future generations that have been destroyed because of simple malaria...
24-12-2005|f|I thought that the melanin in our skin is supposed to protect us from Malaria? The browner you are the more you are protected. I guess this is wrong.
03-4-2005|m|Hello,  This is a thread for those of us who have watched 'Hotel Rwanda' to discuss and review the movie. Feel free to be as free or formal as you like.  Seun.
05-4-2005|f|well i aint one of those who have watched it and am i missing somfn there?
05-4-2005|f|dominobaby, you are indeed missing something here. Trust me, that film is simply amazing for want of a better qualifier. It's just not your everyday movie and all the more impressive because it's simply relating a true life story (Genocide in Rwanda, not as gory as the title suggests, dont worry). You're positively gonna be on the edge of your chair from the very start to the end and even thereafter. I'll leave you to see the movie but you can check out the review at www.hotelrwanda.com
14-6-2005||are u kidding me? I think every black man should watch that movie. I am not in Ninja so peeps i know what i am saying here. I watched the movie in the theater and all the whites were crying. It is by far the best that hollywood has release about the black race.... As per we Nigerians.... we all know about the Civil war, we know about all the killing that happen around us everyday. Lets face it - it is high time we started repairing, I am talking to we Nigerians...
22-6-2005|f|that movie was great. The girl was a NIgerian girl (thumbs up for her). her name is some igbo name like that
18-8-2005|m|please i cant stand this Sophie Okonedo is Austrialian please
18-8-2005|f|She's mixed, right? Either way all of the actors did a wonderful job in that movie. It did a great job at potraying what happened. It should be a film watched by all.
18-8-2005|f|Okonedo isn't australian. She was Born in London to a Nigerian father and a British mother. tada!
18-8-2005|f|hot_angel, right you are! She said as much in an interview after the Hotel Rwanda. Erm... uncle Terry, seems lik we are the ones who 'can't stand this anymore', don't you think?
19-8-2005|f|Ohh and that Nigerian Man is an Igbo man. So terry...whaddayafink?
26-8-2005|f|I am not a Nigerian but I have seen Hotel Rwanda, and I liked it alot. I heard that this is the first major Hollywood movie about genocide in Rwanda. Did not like the ending song by Wyclife(i think?) too much though, the lyrics... And I hope the world would pay more attention to what is happening to Sudan now.  (i know this thread is about hollywood movie Hotel Rwanda but please allow me to mention) I also recommend another movie called "Sometimes in April", made by HBO, story about genocide in Rwanda.    Unfortunately Hotel Rwanda has not hit theatres here yet. (i saw the video tape orderd from Amazon.com) People are collecting signatures to the ditributor, hope they will open here so that more people can see it.
29-8-2005|f|Sophie Okonedo is an Edo girl( from her dad's side) n i think she did a good job on her part n so did Don Cheadle too. D movie was really touching, havin to c wat those ppl passed thru.
19-10-2005|m|that movie was the BOMB BOMB BOMB !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i watched it 12 times its oscar worthy don chealde and sophie okonedo did a great job the making was fantastic,perfect casting,it was so much it expressed the conflict between the hutu and tutsi's of those days which is significant to the african culture and history bravo to that movie
26-10-2005|m|How can man be so wicked to butcher his fellow man.I just finished watching a movie called HOTEL RWANDA.They are killing people like they are at the slaughter house .the genocide took place in 1994,within one week about eight hundred thousand people were killed and they were called cockroaches.Too Bad
06-12-2005|f|it was a really good movie and i will advice all yall to go watch it because it shows the courage n strength n togetherness of african people
06-12-2005|f|it was a really good movie and i will advice all yall to go watch it because it shows the courage n strength n togetherness of african people even though some africans were been cruel and killing each other it still is a good movie.
06-12-2005|f|This film is amazing, I could not believe what I was watching actually happened. It made me review my life and all the things I moan about. I cried and I never cry at movies, it was deep.
09-1-2006|f|Refernce ========================  1. 
09-1-2006|m|I have not seen Hotel Rwanda and sure do I am going to make a dash to get a copy. But have any of you seen Sometimes in April - another film about the Rwanda Genocide. I can bet you that was another movie that is great. I hgope these films are shown across the globe especially in Africa to warn people about the grave and great consequences of wars and the likes.
09-1-2006|f|@ Littleone, i haven't seen that..i'll look for it. The Constant Gardner is another african film(sorta)..y'all shud check it out!
10-1-2006|m|Hotel Rwanda is one movie that really made me HATE our leaders for always bringing out tribal issues whenever they want to achieve their selfish aims, we should all learn from the movie, nobody is going to save us from our troubles. There was a scene in the movie when some africans and Foreigners (Europeans and americans) where in a hotel now the Hutus where on their way to the hotel to slaughter the tutsis in that hotel when the U.N force came to evacuate the foreigners they refused to take the africans with them even though they could. My point is let's stop looking always to the west for solution to our problems we can do better if we contribute to the betterment of our own peoples
10-1-2006|f|Well said dafman.
23-1-2006|f|i saw hotel rwanda here in london with my boyfriend who is a foreigner and some of his clan members.................lets just say there was no dry eye in the audience that day.my oyinbo boyfriend that can like to pose and do hard man...chei..hotel rwanda floored him...infact he was wailing like a baby....that has to be one of the saddest movies i have ever seen.shame those that could have done something to help out when the whole genocide thing was breaking out were too busy worrying about the fact that those they were to help "were not just n*&&*rs but africans"....what a shame.... but there is a GOD.
24-1-2006|f|what a coincidence that i found this thread. i'd just seen this movie last night. it was so sad. my mom said it was like nigeria during the war. man, i cried...still sad,man.*sniffles* i kept yelling at the screen. man, if i wuz there, i woulda....grrr!!!!
24-1-2006|f|yeah, i knew that name had to be african. it sounded nigerian, mainly igbo but i wasn't sure.
24-1-2006|f|hi i have watched both films and i dont know which is more pathetic but i believe what really described the rwandan pple`s situation generally at that time was sometimes in april.unlike hotel rwanda,it did not limit itself to the hotel but showed what women,children went through and i pray it does not happen again ever.
27-9-2006|m|Those Tutsi cockroaches!!!  Something interesting is that ifind it hard how Don Cheadle,an african-american could talk like an African.!!
27-2-2010|m|if u were there you would have done nothing.
04-4-2005|m|I've created this thread as a place where you can introduce your pet dog.  My first dog was a cross between an Alsatian and what we know as the 'local breed'. I named [I]him[/I] 'Jack', of course . But he ran away 2 days before the day he was scheduled to be sold: he used to make a lot of noise at night, trying to find a way to leave the house to mate with female dogs in heat. Jack is the only dog I ever regarded as "mine": I was his primary care-giver, and I was about 10 years old. He hardly ever barked at anybody; he preferred to play all the time!  Our current dogs are named 'Billy' and 'Shermin'. Both of them are castrated males. Shermin is Billy's son-in-law. Billy had a sister called 'Nala' who mated with an Alsatian-mongrel (like Jack) and gave birth to 3 puppies in our house. Shermin was one of them. You cannot enter our compound if our dogs have not been secured in their cage. Unlike Jack the playful, Billy and Shermin dogs will bark at your, scratch you, and bite you, regardless of who is with you when they see you.  As far as I am concerned, Billy and Shermin are my sister's dogs. She named them (she's better at naming pets!) and when she's at home she does the hard work of keeping them clean. The food they eat is specially prepared white rice with boiled fish and no stew. They don't eat rice with stew in it!
04-4-2005|f|We had several dogs while I was growing up in Ibadan. I love dogs with a passion but that passion became significantly dim in 1999 when I lost my very own dog. He was a pure Labrador and absolutely out of this world (well, he's gone back there, hasn't he?). I named him 'Blacky' because he was black all over save for a hint of white on his neck.  He simply took to me out of the other dogs the minute he trotted into the house. There were times I could have sworn that Blacky understood my moods. We were that close. I would take him for walks amidst several admiring glances from onlookers, bathe him every blessed Saturday morning, go for drives together and the likes.  Anyways, he was poisoned by men of the underworld in several abortive attempts to gain entrance into our compound. He eventually gave in and died. It was indeed a sad day. I remember I was writing my exams in UI then and my folks kept the news from me till I finished and came home. Such was my closeness to the dog. Suffice to say that I've ever since kept a safe distance between our dogs and myself.  The last time I was home there were 2 huge dogs christened 'Tiger' and 'Betsy' by my mum, no less. Tiger looks very much like one but I really don't know anything about him. My present living conditions do not permit owning a dog, but I very much suspect that should I move into an accommodation with a garden or some space enough for a roomy kernel tomorrow, I'll be getting myself another Blacky.
04-4-2005|m|Personally 'I' don't have a dog rather 'we' my family have two: 'Captain' and 'Duchess' (should be Duchess 2, I call her Sultana). Anyway we believe Captain is a cross btw a German Shepherd and a local while Duchess is an Alsatian. Captain is about nine years and the one I prefer; unfortunately I haven't visited my family for a while, so I don't know how well they are doing. Anyway, captain is a 'bota' dog - he knows the difference between white rice and jollof rice - usually never finishes the white, and he can be very picky about his food.  Anyway the first dog we ever had was called prince and since that time we've had a tradition of giving our dogs aristocratic names: Prince, emperor, duke, duchess, colonel, captain etc very funny eh?  I once had a pic of me and captain on my yahoo site but have removed it.  Captain once taught me to respect the old adage: 'Let sleeping dogs lie'. I'll talk about it another time, and of course he's my favorite.  That reminds me, I am a member of one Yahoo pet group, and once I was chatting with an American woman and she asked me what we fed our dog. I told her that buying those dog foods that they give their dogs is too expensive so we just give our dogs the same as what we eat. She then told me that to do that over there would be too expensive .
23-4-2005|m|Attention Dog Breeders: Please make sure to post to this forum if you're a dog breeder. Or if you own a female pure-bred Alsatian, Rottweiler or other breed. Be sure to take a look at this 'dog wanted' ad. Do you have cute pictures of your dog? Let's see them!
28-4-2005|m|I had four Dogs at home before i left for school. Jack(Mongrel) , Spark(Some funny hairy hybrid really short fat and fluffy dog very fluffy), Billy(mongrel) and Fluke(Rot and dubberman cross).  Jack was the first and was my favorite Dog. he could understand every sign i made and even my emotions he knew when i was angry, Sad and Happy. We played all the time. and Men Jack Loved to play. Jack's like the closest friend I've had after Tim.  Spark Loves alot of petting belongs to my younger sister. He also love to join me and jack in playing. but he often get angry quickly. and when that happens he just walks away.  Billy is always shy and almost never plays with humans. except when you bring it food he has no tail like Fluke so his tail always looks funny when he wags.  Fluke is a very shy but playfull Dog and he's got more Rot genes in him that a dubber man he's got the dauber man physique(lean waist, big chest, strait ears, no tail,) and he's got the rot behaviors described above. Silent until after the strike. He bite some of my Dad's friend when we forget to lock his cage.  I took a picture with Jack once i mean my mum took our picture though i can't locate that pic anymore. It was really nice... He was licking my eyes and refused to look at the camera.  Mongrels are lovely breeds. they are very very lovely and can learn a lot. They understand you when you are so close to them and in my case Jack could understand emotions. I never really saw these then until years after. Looking back i can see th beauty of loving an animal. Especially a Dog.  I don't know where they breed dogs in town. But i will get one when i settle i sure will.

06-12-2005||Hey all, theres a new website for Dog Breeders in Nigeria. Its an association of Dog Breeders - Dog Breeders Association Nigeria DBAN Visit   Ciao
22-7-2006|f|well, I have owned a 4 ft iguana named Iggy (how original of a name, huh?), numerous fish, a garter snake, a chameleon, a pit bull, a border collie, a dingo, a black lab, a mongrel, a husband (oops, this is about non-human pets, huh?), three cats (Momma, Sweetpea and Kiva), and I have bred golden retrievers since 1999. My current goldens, Ike and Tina, have had 5 beautiful litters. I owned a puppy from one of their litters, but was only able to keep her, named Miranda, for a year. I am a dog lover - I love everything about them. Ike and Tina have distinct personalities. Ike is very protective, but he has a very "chilled out" personality. Tina, on the other hand, is a drama junkie, who needs constant attention and petting. Ike has a huge vocabulary - if I say, "Ike, who's upstairs - go check the door.", he'll drop whatever he's doing and go upstairs and bark. Tina is a bit more challenged - she hasn't been able to distinguish between the words toy and moth. So when moth season comes and I ask her to get a moth, she inevitably grabs one of her toys. Or if I ask her to get a toy, she stalks a moth, go figure,  lm

21-8-2006|f|We always had dogs but non was for me. The first dog we had was called lucy she died at the age of 12 lucy followed us everywere we even used totake her to the village and lucy loved to swim. But lucy was a disgrace she was afride of hens., There were these mother hens that used to run after her.we were the joke of tthe hood. Billy was also a dog we had billy must have ended a a pot because one day he did not come home again. We had cleo as in Cleopatra my father had to shoot her, cleo was a bit mad and started attacking us. I think my sister must have brought home like 3 doges that she picked up somewere on her way home from school and all were mad my dsd shoot them all. But from all the dogs we had it was only lucy and billy1 and 2 that left an impact on us. we also had a cat called Kitty-Cat all the dogs we had were afride of her. They all used to eat from the same plate. but no dog deared to eat without allowance from Kitty-Cat. Sometimes Kitty-Cat will sit at the gate and sometimes a stary dog will feel like coming into the compound. But on seeing Kitty-Cat will stop at the gate and not have the guts to come in. Yes Kitty-Cat even used to fight snakes. even dogs, one slap from her on their lips with her claws made them run tail between their legs. Kitty-Cat died at the age of 15, she fell asleep under a tree and did not wake up. she was buried under the tree.

04-4-2005|m|This thread is for those of us who own or have owned pet cats (or kittens) at one time or the other.  Well, my name is Seun and I want to talk about a female cat named 'Blacky'. Blacky was bought at Ilesha, Osun state together with another male cat we named 'Browny', and she was with us for more than 6 years. (Browny left us after about a yar, as male cats often do).  Every 3 or 4 months, Blacky would go into heat. She would climb to the top of a bus in our compound, or the fence, and start [I]crying[/I]. Then we would start seeing strange cats, presumably male, in our compound. Next thing you know, Blacky would be pregnant! Blacky usually give birth to at least 3 kittens per litter.  When I got my first dog, Blacky refused to accept him. Jack was a gentle dog, so Blacky would hiss at him, scratch him, spit at him (out of fear)! However, the kittens she gave birth to after we got Jack were used to Jack and would play with him.  When she developed an infection under her mouth, my dad decided that it was time to get rid of her. There was no attempt to get her to a Vet doctor; she was sold to a butcher. Till this day I am angry with my dad for making that decision because Blacky was part of our lives for more than 6 years.  About the names: - I named the male cat 'Browny' because he had brown-on-white stripes. - I named the female cat 'Blacky' because she had black on white stripes (example). Are you seeing a pattern here? No wonder my sister now chooses names for all our pets.
04-4-2005|m|This is the second time I am making the mistake of replacing Ra's post with mine instead of simply replying to Ra's post.  Ra: I am so sorry, but I've lost your post again. Please forgive me for making the same mistake twice. What follows is my reply to your post in which you described how you 'dislike cats, probably due to their scratching and spitting nature.  In captivity, cats typically live 15 to 20 years, though the oldest known cat lived to age 36. Domestic cats live longer if they are not permitted to go outdoors (thus avoiding fights and accidents) and if they are spayed or neutered (source)  Cats handling requires more skill than dog handlin: they are not as social as dogs. Blacky, for example, was very aggressive and easily scared. She spent the first 3 or 4 days in our home hidden in a crevice under a building in our compound! Having handled that cat, I can understand your hatred for cats. The trick is to never, ever let the cat get scared of you. Cats are not as forgiving as dogs.  Unfortunately for pet-lovers, there are no animal rights in Nigeria. We are still working on our human rights!

28-3-2007|m|Our friend, the cat  The cat, from the Carnivora order, is an outstanding meat eater. They are excellently designed for capturing and killing live prey. Cats are intelligent, alert and powerfully muscled. They are known to be quite finicky having an air of sophistication about them and are independent.  The domesticated cat (Felis domesticus) was first domesticated in ancient Kemet, Egypt. They were essential in keeping the Egyptian storehouses free of pesky rodents. The Egyptians also worshipped a cat-headed deity called Sekhmet, also worshipped by the ancient Greeks and Romans . . .  Source:   Sekhmet,a cat-headed deity

04-4-2005|f|Welcome, Catholic faithfuls. We can share our views about the church here. Announcements about changes, activities affecting the church generally can be shared here. Sometimes too if we have questions we can post and anybody can answer (please references should be posted along with answers). Non-catholic Christians can also post questions here (no fanatics and criticism please!).
05-4-2005|m|Angelgirl: thanks for your foresight in making this announcement. However, catholics should note that issues affecting the catholic church can be posted directly in the Religion section. There's no need for a special thread yet.  However, you can use this thread to introduce yourself to other catholics in the forum! So if you're catholic, please introduce yourself and tell us a little about your faith here!
14-4-2005|f|I am always happy each time I come across people who share the same faith as I do. I have been a catholic all my life and I pray nothing, I mean absolutely nothing seperates me from my church. What I love and cherish most is the celebration of mass in Latin so Angelgirl, In nomine patris et filii, et spiritus sancti. Amen.
14-4-2005|f|Tayo, although I'm Anglican by birth, I completely identify with you. Nothing beats the services, the communion and the closeness you feel to the supernatural when blessings are being said. Some parts of our liturgies are in Latin as well and however much I go to Pentecostal churches, I always need a touch of my home church once in every while. Absolutely nothing in the world beats carols at Christmas or Easter renditions, not if it's St. Paul's choir rendering it. I was 10 minutes late last year and met hundreds of people in the same shoes outside the church. It was too full to allow us in. I practically cried all the way home and consoled myself with the TV version on getting home. This year, God willing, Im going to be an hour early.
15-4-2005||well i'm a catholic since birth. my secondary education was partly in a seminary, but priesthood wasn't for me so i'm here today. my mates all things being equal will be priest in about 4-5 years time. and man what a time that will be. i served mass, taught cathchesim and all that Catholic stuff...although presently i wouldn't say i'm very religious but i still keeps it positive.  it's a pity posting fever on this forum is not picking up as fast as it did on Mobilenigeria. i miss that forum now. no body goes there much these days...and they ain't coming here that much. i just pray we won't regret this switch to Nairaland in a months time.
21-4-2005|m|In my own case, I am a lapsed catholic (because I believe I have found so many contradictions in the theology)  Anyway lets not spoil the fun for you. I like the sense of brotherhood that being a member of one of the largest churches in the world creates, but I don't really like orthodox churches.  Anyway see you! In case you want to discuss contradictions, buzz me.
21-4-2005|m|Kodewrita, I think you're trying to say that you're a 'backslider'!
18-5-2005|f|Catholics visit www.wau.org for daily meditationals and mass readings.
18-5-2005|m|Like Ra, I'm Anglican by birth but I most frequently attend the Catholic mass in school at the Our Lady Seat of Wisdom(well, let's say the timing is convenient)-I don't get the communion though 'cos i'm not a communicant.
18-5-2005|f|Thank you, Angelgirl. I have always known they have a site but never visited it. I buy the monthly edition in my parish@ Lekki, now you have given me the opportunity to visit the website. What parish do you attend?
18-5-2005|m|Trish going all cozy on another Catholic sister. Quite good!
20-5-2005|f|@ Allenpowered.  Will it be "quite good if I go on cozy" with you? Oh what am I doing? This isn't a flirting thread. But you asked for it!
20-5-2005|f|May Devotions  Ave Maria.  This post is coming a little late, we have few days left in the month of May and remember brothers and sisters that this is the month of Mary our Mother. But it is never too late in the house of the Lord, so please do remember to say your rosary and meditate on them. Glory be to Jesus, honour to Mary.
20-5-2005|m|What's so significant about Mary and May?  IMO, MARY / R = May is it?
20-5-2005|m|@seun I am not a backslider as I am still a christian but I have encountered many irregularities and I find it hypocritical to still call myself a catholic in spite of my disagreements with the faith (which sadly cathechism has not healed)  @practising catholics answer the following questions? What is the relevance of the bible verse in one of the gospels which names the brothers of Jesus? if indeed they were named is Mary still EVER VIRGIN.  even if she did not give birth to any other kid, does that mean she was chaste forever in light of the jewish tradition of reconsummating marriages every friday.  Is church tradition superior to the bible? if not then why does the bible claim that mary did not die when it is only church tradition that came into the common consciousness close to 2 centuries after Jesus crucifixion?  Where in the bible is it stated that catholics get to absolve their sins after death (In purgatory)?  there are more questions but I believe you won't be able to answer them because like me u have been bred to believe that " blessed are those that don't see but believe" when a different verse states that we should test what we are told (check thessalonicans or search for berea in any online bible.) Half of you don't know if there is any biblical basis for your beliefs. Check these topics 1. the trinity 2. purgatory 3. Jesus being the only way (christianity) to the exclusion of other ways (or religions) 4. sainthood and whether it agrees with no 3(Jesus the only intercessor) 5. bowing to the statue or painting of Jesus at easter
20-5-2005|m|@kodewrita, I think you better take cover cos I can sense flames coming your way from our Catholic Faithfuls........ I'm not a Catholic but I respect you guys & I gotta say I've heard so many things sha, some good, some well.......
20-5-2005|m|Kodewrita's comments are null and void because Angelgirl clearly said "no fanatics and criticism please!" in the first post. Please ignore them or discuss them in a different thread.
23-5-2005|m|kodewriter was trying to express his inner self, in seeking answers maybe that would heal his inner conflicts.  without criticsm, there can be no progress in any society. and believe me kodewriter all bliefs have there own 'inconsistencies', only faith makes one pull through.  man u must have bottled those your thoughts in for years,the way they came ou was hot
24-5-2005||I used to resent going for mass when i was in my teens. In school i would stay in dormitory o sundays and i wouldn't care when all those holier than thou folks would try to give me grief. During the Holidays i would have to deal with long masses in the village, God forbid if we had harvest, we would be their through lunch. Now that I'm older and i can make my own decisions with regards to mass, i enjoy going. I find comfort in the readings and i look forward to it. When i leave, its with the hope of applying what I've heard to my daily routine through out the week.  Thats just a personal reflection on what being a catholic means to me.  What does it mean to u?
25-5-2005||ezinne i'm happy for u. but sha one advice to our priest: they really need to work on their preaching skills. many of them sorry to say are poor preachers. if they were in the protestant section and couldn't preach, talk less of perform miracles i don't think their churches would be growing at all.
01-6-2005|m|i agree with angelgirl and seun that there should be no criticism. It is only allowed in objective areas and not issues of faith.  @allenpowered you school in IB. i might run into you one of these sundays. i worshipped there for a while and i still visit from time to time (especially when i am late for other church services or when i am travelling.)  @angelgirl holding convictions or beliefs is easy but the true test of your belief is being able to stand up to an attack on those beliefs.
01-6-2005|m|Yes, kodewrita, go ahead and analyse/criticize the faith but not in this thread. That is all I am saying.  Since the person that created the thread has said clearly that she's not interested in the debate you should show her that respect and create a new thread to discuss those issues!
01-6-2005|f|@Trish, sorry i have not been very regular on this forum lately, am just reading your post today, my parish is in Festac Town, 'Holy Family'.  @Kodewriter, sorry, am just reading your post today too, When i started this thread, we didnt have up to a hundred members, but i had a foresight (expected) of questions like yours springing up as membership increase, that was why i said 'no critisizms', please this thread is a meeting point for 'catholics' who know why they are catholics, you have questions, i have questions too, its a challenge for us if we claim to be catholics but if you are too keen on answers then sacrifice some time to see your parish priest/ elders in the church/ or go make enquiry in the church library (i know the church is good at keeping records), or better still start another thread, maybe you will get the answers you need. @Traez, Everybody has their individual gift, so also every leader in the church, a pastor/priest gifted with healing powers will do well in healing ministrations, while the orators do well in preaching, i know a handfull of our priest who do well in preaching, we as parishoners are supposed to augment some of their weak areas, that is why we have the charismatic renewal (have you discovered your charisma/spiritual gift?), You dont have to be a pastor/priest before you can preach, heal, you will do well if you are gifted.
09-6-2005|m|@ Angelgirl you can never be too keen. but in deference to seun i'll leave the thread and if moved i'll start one detailing links and topics buttressing my points. anyway, congrats, the church has sucessfully forgotten the crusades, the al Aqsa massacre and the Holocaust(where they stood by)
16-6-2005|m|kodewrita,you seems to know little about religion. read the following The "Bible" means books where ''written word of God'' are kept by the traditions of catholics - The "Tradition" is the word of God becoming real in the life of the Church. The Tradition is the word of God lived and preached in the Church. This Tradition is transmitted "orally", and often it is printed (Luke.1:2). In Christ's time there was no printing, so, very few people could read anything from the books and the Gospels were not yet written... and they were very good Christians those in the Catacombs, without the New Testament written!... and, in fact, until the sixteenth century very few books were written. When was printing press and computers came?  Some Protestants argue they only have the Bible, and no Tradition. But they deceit themselves, because the way they celebrate worship is usually Tradition, very different from one denomination to another... the services and songs of the Lutherans are different of those of the Methodists or Pentecostals... they understand and live the Sacraments in very different ways from denomination to denomination, but the same denomination practice them usually in the same ways, as a Tradition taught by the founder or leaders... and that's Tradition.  Every branch, or denomination, or cult add to the Bible the scriptures of their founders or leaders. And these added scriptures are often very important, usually the ones followed by the denomination or cult to carry their religious services and to guide the actual life and stile of their members. Look at Holy Scriptures  For the Lutherans, for example, the Bible is the Holy Scripture... however what rules and regulates their rituals, administration, and the practical way of life is the "Book of Concord" and their many rules and regulations of their synods.  The same rule is applicable for each one of the many Christian Denominations... it is actually what the Catholics call "Tradition", and it is what actually makes the difference between one Christian Denomination ant other.  The same rule applies to each Branch or Denomination of Judaism, Islam, or Eastern Religions. Stop that act please.
20-6-2005|m|@HNDHolder If I know anything about religion, I do know a lot about the catholic faith. I have read extensive reports written both by insiders and outsiders.  Why I used the word tradition is simple. In catholic church, traditions are usually based on the following principle  1 that the tradition is something to be expected  2 because it is expected then it is right.  example: the belief that mary being the earthly mother of christ cannot be allowed to die by god (refer to 1). Therefore because that was concieved to be the right thing then it was called church canon. HNDHolder, you point fingers at people but you forget that it also holds for you too, you follow the traditions of Abdrushin, founder of the grail message and as such your thinkiing is colored by that.  As to the writing of the scripture, they were already in written form at the time of Christ. Read Early Isreal And Surrounding nations on www.gutenberg.net for more information about the culture of writing.Reading and writing was already present, though many could not read in either hebrew or greek (like many muslims can't read arabic in nigeria). The fact still remains that they held the scripture to be the sole arbiter of all disputes but the church maintains that tradition is superior. Take for example, the church talks about purgatory but ignores the idea of the existence of hell when purgatory can be proved to be non-existent and hell to be existent based on biblical fact. We Xtians hold the bible to be complete and believe it's writings were inspired by God and anything outside it that does not agree with anything inside it is not biblical.  I am not Catholic, Protestant , Mormon or anything. I AM SIMPLY CHRISTIAN.
20-6-2005|m|Good luck
05-7-2005|m|For me, I think one of the things that have kept me in the catholic church is the selflessness of the religious. Not only have they remained celibate for christ, they have also dedicated themselves to go and evangelize anywhere there is a need. The words of St Teresa of Avila always makes me emotional. On travelling through dangerous terrain for evangelism, her cart broke down, and she said to God jokingly "Lord, if you treat your friends like this, its no wonder you have so few"
08-7-2005|m|funny you would say...ca tholitism and tradition, what is tradition? I believe would be the most reasonable question to ask in the worship of God, who can not be faulted?  There are rules. God expects to be worship in a certain way,......they that worship the Lord, must worship in in truth and in Spirit..(emphasis Spirit in caps)  The second question is what does tradition(way of interraction) got to do with the Spiritual nature of man? noting that He(Spirit) is the third person of the trinity with a mind of His own.  I would just encourage that you all spent time and study the great resemblance between now Catholicism(Roman catholics) and the Babylonian religion, wherein a whole country by order[b][/b] of the Roman leader became Born again', 'christians' and 'catholics' in one day. The greatest revival in the history of Christianity you would say?  The funny thing was that the Leader before him had already declared the same people into the Babylonian worship now immediately after him another is declaring the same people into Christianity, jugding by the complex nature of man, all please try to imagine what would really really result from these declarations. Do you now have an idea why it is a bit cumbersum to try to separate 'Roman' Catholicism from Babylonian religion? ....yes all these is as a result of intermedling tradition with the worship of God. '...the latter killeth but the Spirit giveth lift.....'
29-7-2005|m|I am a catholic and I will die a catholic. Its the only church where I know the in and out of her working and am sure we dont use any ungodly power; I was once a mass servant, there is no hidden thing. Most of these so called new generation churches are based on the principle of what the owner/founder can get. But the Catholic Church is quite different; fathers dont have children/family so the incentive of them being corrupt is not there.  Money realized get plowed back into the community and to people that are suffering around the world, but where do other churches put their money?
29-7-2005|m|I was a mass server too. Where do those pastor founder put their money............... Good talk
29-7-2005|m|been absent from this post for a while.  interesting how both of you referred to the money angle. Let me inform you that the catholic church remains the richest church in the world and aside from a few organisations like the Jesuits and The Daughters Of The Holy Spirit, they have done less when compared to some churches like the Salvation Army. You are simply parroting what we are told every sunday in church by Rev. Frs anxious to maintain church populations. What shd you be concerned with? your money or your soul. If you are as catholic as you claim, answer the questions i wrote up there in the earlier posts.
05-4-2005|m|This thread is for you to talk about what you do every morning to make your body look beautiful.  Let me get the ball rolling. I'm male, about 23, and my daily beauty routine is: 1) Take a bath. 2) Dry my body. 3) If I see any pimples on my face, I use an alcohol-based face cleanser. 4) There is no step 4!  Ok, so what's yours like?
05-4-2005|m|I rush to take my shower in the morning. If I have enough time I use soap, otherwise I don't. That will have to wait till night, when I am back. I will stand Unclad infront of the fan to dry myself. I don't like using the towel to dry myself. I will hurriedly put on my clothes. If my palm is feeling dry, I will rub some cream on it. Then off I go. If I can remember, I will check my face in my car rear view mirror to see what I look like, then ignore it. Lest I forget, I am a male always with a skin hair-cut.
05-4-2005|f|That's a very interesting routine Seun, but I think you might want to use a low alcohol-based face cleanser for your pimple.  Me next! my daily beauty routine is a very simple one. I love to pamper my skin and as such I take very good care of it.  1. I start by applying a facial scrub, which helps remove impurities- dirt, sebum etc. 2. I take a bath using the local soap, you see I have a very beautiful and clear skin and would like to keep it that way, so I am very careful not to expose my skin to soaps and creams that would leave my skin dry and unevenly toned. 3. Next, I apply a mild cream on my body. 4. Make-up time, I like to apply light make-up to work, so I only powder my face, apply eye-pencil on my brow and eye shadow faintly, then lipstick. 6. Comb my hair, arrange my braids as the case may be. 7. Evening, facial srub to remove make-up etc, so that my skin can breathe again! then I take my bath before going to bed. I don't use night creams.  My secret is, I stick with my routine for maximum results.  diakim: Very funny. I guess that, because you are a guy, you don't really care huh?
06-4-2005|f|Ok fellows, here goes: I am female, 19. I do not really have a routine. It all depends on my mood.  1) I shower at night so I do not have to shower in the morning cos I have got to play tennis pretty soon so I shower after that. 2) Wake up, excercise first if I have the time, brush, shower with antiseptic soap (those other stuff in the market dry your skin). 3) Apply body lotion, body splash, and deodorant. 4) Comb out my hair. Two things I am proud of in myself is my hair and my body. I have got pretty long hair and my hair grows fast. I do not like braiding it; I hardly do that. (I am athlethically built) 5) If am am like really lazy I just run my hand through my hair and tie it up or just let it down (all these depend on my mood). 6) No make up for me. I can not stand that stuff: I feel it is a waste of time and I do not seem to need it anyhow. I like myself the way I am. I guess that, when I start working, then I would just put on a light one. Oh well, will see how that goes. 7) I take hours deciding on what to wear, but mostly I prefare tops and jeans or shorts; just anything that will keep me comfy! 8.) At night, I shower but that depends. I wash my face with facial clensers, I brush my teeth and gargle with mouth wash, and I am ready to sleep.
12-4-2005||hey this stuff looks like some ladies stuff, and u know u gotta be the man always . so i guess not to make myself look bad i'll say my rou-whatever..routine is like that of prince Akim (eddie murphy) in "coming to america"

I only rub my body with body-cream in dry seasons when my skin looks dry.  And of course, I check out myself in the mirror.

31-10-2005|f|i can't live w/o deodorant and bodyspray. i get all sweaty after practice so i keep a set in my gym locker at school too because i hate the girls shower and i take the bus so....
02-11-2005|m|WesleyanA: When you mix the strong odour from body sweat with the sweet smell of a perfume, the resulting smell is something in-between - you're going to smell like the sun-dried seafish sold in Lagos!
03-11-2005|f|I use body spray not perfume. they are two different things  and it's not even like i keep the same clothes on.. plus i use deodorant too. . .  (you're a guy and you live in nigeria where it's always 100 degrees outside. here it's cold and i'm female we don't sweat and stink like guys ).  trust me i always smell good after practice and when i get home from school, i take a nice shower.
03-11-2005|f|Female, 24. Routine as follows:  1. Spend maximum time in bed so I wake up late and rush to brush my teeth 2. Put on a shower cap and take a shower. 3. Wash face in shower with facial scrub stuff 4. Dry off and put on lotion (although I must admit that I don't lotion every part all of the time. It depends on how late I am. 5. Brush hair back into a pony tail 6. Get dressed, put on deoderant, run out the door.  No make up. No jewlery. I don't get into either one. I may spray a bit of purfume if I remember but the soap and lotion smell good enough. I don't like strong smells. Oh, and I put on some chapstick. Not very impressive.
03-11-2005|f|-wake up -say ma mornin' prayers / make ma bed -take ma shower/ brush ma teeth -put some lotion and deodorant -put on ma clothes/ sneakers or wateva shoe wear for the day -put on my eye shadow (very imp), mascara and lip gloss (no powder) -wear ma perfume -i'm good to go!

25-3-2006||1) get up 2) have breakfast 3)wash face 4)go straighten hair 5)put on makeup 6)brush teeth
26-3-2006|f|I don't know if girls know this, But it's not technically right to use your facials (face wash, facial cleansers etc), in the morning when you are about to apply make-up. If you do that, you'll be covering the "facial wash" with your make-up, thus not making it do what it's spose to do. You are normally suppose to apply facial cleansers when you want to go to bed, or when you know u don't need make-up on your face/u not going out. Your are spose to wash your face, rub watever u use, let it do it's work, after you wake up, take your bath and wash it all off, that's how u get a 'fresh' face. Not by covering the cleansers with 'extra-make up'. Just thought i should let y'all know.  My routine, i know it should be long but it isn't. Wake up, say prayers (i forget sometimes, but remeber late on in the bath tub, n say it there). Run to restroom, sit on toilet seat, do watever the fxck i want to do there, while i brush (what?) Get up after doing my business, rinse my mouth, and brush one more time (i have a bad child-hood habbit of brushing like two/three times in a row). Go in the tub, shower (as long as i do it depends on whether or not im late to a place). Get out the bath, wipe my body off in the restroom, Come inside my room, apply lotion, deoderant, hair cream, hair spray, do hair, Making up depends on where im going. If im not going out. I use my lip gloss, wear watever i want to wear. And im done. If im going out, well, that's a whole new story on it own, i sit on my make-up chair, and do my thing. I use "Covergirl" for everything now. I just love cover-girl, easy breezy beautiful cover-girl. When im done, spray perfume, annoint my self, look at the mirror and bam, im done. with the face of course. Trust me, it's not as quick as it sounds, especially when im going out.  When im back from wherever i go, And i know im not going out anymore, i go wash my face with my normal dove bar soap. Before i sleep at night, i use my clean and clear facial wash. And bam im off to bed.  Doing that saves me from using foundation and heavy make-up. When the face is fresh, there really isn't much make-up to do in the morning. Rather i would have minor "finishing touches" to do.
28-3-2006|f|well,it's all ok,but I also want to let us know that cleanser doesn't work for everybody,so find out what is good for u from a dermatologist and adhere to it.
28-3-2006|f|Cleanser is not a specific product. Whatever you dermatologist prescribes for you, is a facial cleanser. I think i get your point tho, you mean so many products works differently for so many faces, so we should ask a dermatologist. Okay that's true,
31-3-2006|m|Mine is sort of  1. I wake up, take a shower 2. Dry myself and put on my clothes 3. Sometimes I use a haircream to avoid dandruff but most of the time my hair is low because I hate combing.  I don't apply anything -- my skin's very oily so even during harmattan my face gets all covered and I use a bandanna as a hanky because it's so much. I hate deodorants because they irritate my skin and perfumes because they give me a runny nose. I only use faint ones. As for neatness I love white and won't wear anything twice -- except jeans and socks which I wear exactly twice.
01-4-2006|f|I wait for the kids to go . I go after them, put on my pc I light a cigarette I take my bath brush my teeth cream myself get dressed sit at the pc make my hair I make my hair and surf at the same time. make a tee look in the mirror put of everything and go.
01-4-2006|f|I hate to pock-nose, but u wear ur jean pants exactly twice? You'll spoil em if you wash em too much. At least that's wat i've heard and i also probably think it's true. Washing your pants too much make it lose it texture and spoils it.
02-4-2006|m|So I heard too but I wear only jeans -- I hardly wear "normal" trousers. I've got quite a pile.
04-4-2006|f|So do they fade out?
04-4-2006|m|Rarely
23-4-2006|f|take a bath  cream my skin  and dress up  and a lil bit make up on,i only put lip wet on
05-4-2005|m|I am a big fan of Heartsong inspirational romance books (I don't buy them, but my sister does and I read them all!). I recently finished 'Frieda's Song' by Kathleen Scarth, about a marriage of convenience which blossoms into a loving relationship. Currently reading 'The Long Ride Home' by Andrea Boeshaar, about a nurse who falls in love with her cowboy patient who was injured while riding a bull!  A friend sent me 'Forgiving' by Lavyrle Spencer, about a female newspaper publisher who had to rescue her junior sister from a life of prostitution (her sister ran away from home at 15 to get away from her father who was violating her, only to go into prostitution). It's not in the Heartsong series, though.  So what are you currently reading! (Thread locked. Continued here: Which Books/Novels Are You Currently Reading?)
05-4-2005|m|Most of the time I read computer magazines (boring...?). I just finished reading yesterday the March edition of the 'PC Answer' magazine.  I also read other books also (I am not all works and no play). Currently, I am reading the book '48 Laws of Power', by Robert Greene. It is a motivational book. The one I read before it was the 'Instant Millionaire' (can't remember the author's name now), another success and motivational book.
05-4-2005|m|Well, I won't say computer magazines are boring. But the foreign ones tend to be promoting new products (gadgets, software packages) that one cannot necessarily afford! Or products that aren't even available in Nigeria!
05-4-2005|f|Apart from reading my ICSA textbooks for my precariously close exam (boring, I know, sorry), I still found time (albeit I'm ever so guilty about it) to read 'Godfather' for what must be the 100th time. I recently finished a serious comedy titled 'Lucys Wedding' and I'm presently on Robert Ludlum's 'Sigma Protocol'. I strongly recommend it people. It's so amazing I crack my ribs with mirth ever so often. Its simply: a must-read.
06-4-2005|f|One book I've read and recommend is 'Angela's Ashes' if you can comprehend the style and use of English. I've never heard poverty so vividly described its almost as if one is present. It has a sequel called [I]'Tis[/I], also by Frank McCourt. Presently on 'Key to Rebecca' by Ken Follet but not gone far yet, pretty busy right now. I also like Stephen King, Dean Koontz, John Grisham as expected, Robin Cook, Ludlum et al. The list is endless. Also, 'Calvin & Hobbes'.
07-4-2005|f|I love reading a lot and I have read quite a number of books like: - 'Memories of Midnight' (Sydney Sheldon) ~ This book is a sequel, it has all the usual Sheldon's if you know what I mean. What I really remember about this book is a character named Melina, she sacrified her life for her brother. - 'Other Side of Midnight' - 'Sands of Time' - This is one of my favourite from all of his books.(Sydney Sheldon).  Sure, there are some books that I cant remember anymore but I know I have read a lot of Sydney Sheldon and Danielle Steel's books.  |More books I've read| 'A Perfect Stranger', 'Message from NAM', 'Heartbeat' (Danielle Steel), 'Run Away Jury, 'The Firm', 'Painted House' (John Grisham), 'Promise' (Katherine Stone - I guess am right; it's been a while).  Currently, I am reading Princess by Gaelen Goley. In short, I read any interesting book especially adventure and romance.
07-4-2005||'[I]This una big big books dey make me fear[/I]'. '[I]Well me also na book lover sha[/I]'.  Just read 'Toads for Supper' again some weeks back, read 'Hollywood Wives' (hollywood **** novel) and just finished 'Merchants of Flesh'. Forgive me if I'm not into all these big Mills and Boom series stuff or inspirational books. But I guess I'm a walking encyclopedia on relationships and self-help issues , and don't you forget it.
07-4-2005|f|I am a book lover, mostly detective books. Used to read (and still read if it is available) J.H. Chase's books, because he keeps you in suspense and you never can tell what's going to happen in the end!  Wow! I did not see anyone who reads John Grisham books here! He's got a handful of them and most of his books have been acted, like [I]Pelican Brief[/I](by Denzel and J.Roberts). '[I]The Brethren[/I]' is another interesting one. The only thing that might 'scare' you off are the numerous names he's always got at the beginning, but trust me as you read along, u'll love it.  Sidney Sheldon is another good writer but I have only read one of her books; can't remember the title now.
07-4-2005|f|One can never exhaust the list of books really, hence the oversight. I absolutely adore Sidney Sheldon and Jeffery Archer's books. Those are classicals if ever there was one. Titles like; Shall We Tell The President? 'Honour Among Thieves', 'First Among Equals' and so on and so forth. I've read all of them. 'Quiver Full of Arrows', 'Shorts Stories' by J.Archer, 'Thirteenth Commandment'. The list is endless really. As expected, given my profession, I love John Grisham's books as well and if there's any I haven't read, he is yet to publish it. I'll save you the horror of listing them all. But my favourites include 'Pelican Brief', 'Painted House' and 'Time to Kill'. I once couldn't get enough of Danielle Steele's books, but now find them rather repetitive and far too gloomy. Haven't read one in for ever.  dominobaby: Hadley Chase is in a league of its own entirely, unfortunately I suspect the series ran dry. Haven't seen a new one in at least 10 years. D'you remember 'You're Lonely When You're Dead'?, The Things Men Do ... I really can't imagine a life without books. My last Mills & Boon 'storybook' must have been perused in my secondary school days in Sagamu. I said it already, but I'll say it again, Robert Ls 'Sigma Protocol' is a must read for minds that appreciate good literature, carefully woven story line and rich sense of humour.  More to come as I recall ...
11-4-2005|m|Ra: I think the guy James Hadley Chase is dead, that is why you have not been seen a new book from him. I too can't forget titles like, "Like a Hole in The Head", "You Find Him, I Will Fix Him", "Double Shuffle', "The Way The Cookie Crumbles", etc.
11-4-2005|f|Alright, since whetting appetites for movies and books is what I'm doing tonight, it's almost unforgivable that I have made so much noise about the Sigma Protocol without remembering to mention Robert Ludlum's Icarius Agenda. Now, that book almost got me sacked at my last job. Robert Ludlum's books are sort of heavy and if you're not altogether into that kind of literature, you might find it dead boring, but the Icarius Agenda? No chance. It is absolutely hilarious.  I'll give you a brief appetiser. There was deep trouble in the Middle East, Oman to be precise and an American Congressman, a single American, volunteers to go there and solve the problem. He had some history there and lost several of his friends and all. Needless to say, he met loads of obstacles. He had to call for help and eventually, the funniest man in the book in person of Weingrass comes into the picture. Weingrass is like the congressman's godfather and he simply turned the otherwise heavy book into a comedy. It took forever, favours owed paid back, loss of lives, loss of friendship, falling in love and all those sort of things, but at the end of the day, the Oman issue got solved and guess who was elected Vice President.......  This book also dived into some part of American politics, as Robert L. always does and brings up some interesting facts ordinarily unbeknownst to the public.  In a nut-shell, get the book, read it and let's talk about it.
15-4-2005|m|Well, you are talking to the bookworm himself. I have read most John Grisham novels. I will always love Tom Clancy. Here's my list of favourite authors (not arranged in order of importance) 1. Steven King (aarrgh scary. I like 'Pet Sematary' and 'Firestarter' best because they have movies, though I like the other Steven King movies like 'Carrie' 1 and 2). 2. Tom Clancy (Special effects, bombs and missiles) 3.Sidney Sheldon (stories with funny twists, like 'Best Laid Plans' where the girl ends up the loser and the assistant is the villain). 4.John Grisham (I like 'The Firm' and 'The Brethren' - bunch of crooked judges). 5. Dean Koontz (best book in my estimation is 'The House Of Horror') 6. Jeffrey Archer (liked him ever since my dad introduced me to his novels.' Not A Penny More Not A Penny Less' is one of his books I like) 7. Robert Ludlum( 'Road to Omaha'! hilarious) 8. Frederick Forsythe 9. John Gardner (new James Bond author) 10. Eric Van Lustbader (writes Ninja and Samurai stories)  Obviously from the above I am a novel freak (I read at least two novels every two days). I like other authors and I generally read any book I can lay my hands on (with the exception of romance novels, which I believe are unrealistic and too predictable).
16-4-2005|f|I love all kinds of books but I love detective novels most, though I don't really get to read them much. I just read this book 'The Testament, Eleventh Hour' (though I didn't read it all I got the message ) Please who has read 'The Prophet'?
19-4-2005|f|Diakim, how about 'Vulture is a Patient Bird' and 'Want to Stay Alive' (Poke Toholo)? It was like I was watching a movie!  Sorry, want to go way back 7+ years ago when I was in secondary school, and reading books like 'Malory Towers', 'St Claire', 'Nancy Drew'. Anyone read them?
19-4-2005|f|Are you sure you're not my twin sister or something?...... Nancy Drew...name it, I read it. Hardy Boys...... Malory Towers and St. Claire. Next you'll be telling me about Enid Blyton. These books really do bring memories rushing back. I would hide in the school library then with a huge textbook disguising the fact that the serious concentration I'm mustering is for none other than Nancy Drew and her recent 007 moves.
19-4-2005|f|Yeah, the Enid Blyton series, you name them! Of cos memories are rushin Ra, how bout Sweet Valley High! I simply can't forget those books, I clearly remember one day I got back from school and my elder sis just brought home "don't go home with John" and "The Evil Twin", without getting off my uniform i just sat down and digested both books before 8 p.m! Gosh! There were also Sweet Valley University books though I did not get to read much of them.  Speaking of twin sister you might just be Elizabeth and I Jessica(of sweet valley high)lol
20-4-2005|f|Oh bless! I could indeed. But those were really lovely books. More than anything else, they kept you busy, out of trouble and did a thing or two to one's vocab. Anyways, I'm still ever much the book addict, evidently. I'm on vacation from novels now to prepare for my impending exams. But I shall be back with force, I shall.  Having said that I just bought 2 of Jilly Cooper's books on Saturday Pandora and Score. Who's read any of Jilly Cooper's books by the way? They tend to be about horses in one capacity or the other, but they're really nice.
21-4-2005|m|You mean 'Riders' ,'Polo', 'The Man Husbands Love to Hate' (not sure about the last one but the title was similar to that).
21-4-2005|f|Yeah, Riders is yet another one of her books, nice one too at that. The Man Who Made Husbands Jealous is the title you're trying to remember. Another really nice one but so far, I think Pandora takes the trophy, for me.
30-4-2005|f|heres what am reading TERRI MCMILLAN'S .."A DAY LATE AND A DOLLAR SHOR"..([/b]author of "dissapearing acts","waitint to xhale","how stealla got her groove back" i knew it was God sent..its a page turner..its funny,totally takes u into the world of the modern black woman/man....its a must read...the characters seem so full of life,that they breathe dream and shout right off th page...itsa novel about black family healing and redemption.  [b]i also got to read "SOPHIE KINSELLA'S (CAN U KEEP A SECRET)  It was quite entertaining.. loved this amazing book. It makes you laugh and it makes ya cry as sophie kinsella takes you through the consequences of the young girl after spilling her secrets to a stranger on a plane. A great read, a must buy! its a twist on the usual boy meets girl story. This story made me laugh out loud at the cringe worthy events that happen to poor Emma before passing the book onto anyone else that would read it! Just remember never to tell your secrets to anyone!
30-4-2005|f|A word for Terri McMillan, almost all her books have motion pictures and she specialises on the average black woman/man's lives. She usually delivers good stuff. A must-read anyday.
30-4-2005|f|And a good word at that! I've had the priviledge of reading some of her books as well and they are about the typical black family. Very interesting.
04-5-2005|m|sopescott:  Jeez! I read a little bit about a book titled 'The Davinci Code' and almost became apostate. The book was so well written that you can't decipher fact from fiction.  I'm a Christian, and a true Christian, and I am forcing myself not to believe anything in the book. I dont have empirical facts to back my claim, but I believe there is a God in heaven, a Jesus, and of course a heaven.  This book could be an excellent topin for nairaland to discuss. But on a second thought, do we really read books in this part of the world?  Later man.
09-5-2005|f|@sopescott:  Is 'Davinci Code' about free masons? If it is can you just give a brief account of it but don't tell the end. I'm interested.
09-5-2005|m|So where do you people get your books in Nigeria?
09-5-2005|f|Bookstores generally. Some sell new some sell used. Another alternative is to send someone travelling out of the country for latest books.
12-5-2005|m|Give me Robert ludlum anyday and i'll probably leave what i am doing.A Jeffery Archer is ok.A Frederick Forsythe preferable.  I just finished a novel by James Clavell: SHOGUN- damn interesting. anyone read it.its kool to the max.  Then just about anything that comes to my hand gets read no discriminations: computer mags,hint,mystics, christian, motivational, new age stuffs...anything.i'm just getting to read st. augustine's confessions
12-5-2005|f|I completely concur: SHOGUN is, as you put it , is 'damn interesting'. I read it more than 6/7 years ago but still marvel at the piece of work.
23-5-2005|m|[My Holy Bible] I am currently studying my Bible squarely and I don't when I can exhaust it because it is new everyday. Cheers.

05-4-2005|m|Related: MTV Europe Awards 2005: 2Face Idibia Is 'Best African Act'!  Here are the lyrics of the popular song 'African Queen' by 2face Idibia (some people know him as 'tuface idibia'). What do you think of the song? Is it over-rated like some people claim[b] Olufunmi[/b] is?  [I]yeah, yeah,[/I] you are my african queen, [I]oooh lord, oooh lord[/I]  just like the sun, lights up the earth, you light up my life the only one, I've ever seen with a smile so bright and just yesterday, you came around my way and changed my whole scenery with your astonishing beauty  ah, you coulda make a brother sing, you ordinary thing, a supernatural being,  I know you are just brighter than the moon Brighter than the star, I love you just the way you are.

06-4-2005|f|I'm of the personal opinion that Olufunmi is wonderful. African Queen is by no means any less wonderful. The fact that 2Face's vocal quality can not be overlooked makes it even better.  There are three songs I listen to repeatedly and 'Olufunmi' takes the first place, followed by 'African Queen' and "Oruka Ti D'owo Na". I usually leave them on while cleaning on Saturday or something. So, yes, it's really good and I don't think it's overrated.
30-4-2005||Overrated is not the word. the word is "over popular". The song has rained too much that I'm getting sick of it. the same way I'm sick of 'Olufunmi'. Anyway, good luck to 2face. I envy you big time! You're the man.  Now I know why this thread is in the list of top ten thread by views, despite only two replies, it gets so many hits via search engines  . You know, I got a blog and I keep track of my hits so I know that Nigerians and music lovers alike are crazy over 2face material on the net.
30-4-2005|m|All over the world people are crazy about stars. "Britney Spears" has been the top search term on google for years!
01-5-2005|m|I don't know what else to say, because 2Face is the bomb, over here in South Africa, they are very crazy about 2face's album, especially My African Queen, he is just too much, anytime I listen to the track, I always wish I was in Nigeria with my girl. Olufunmi is alright, but another track that I like listening to is Faze's track. I think you guys should check this website www.duduradio.com, because they always make me feel at home. Sharp.
05-5-2005|m|Trae, I have always thought you are an artiste worth his salt but I might have to disagree with your view for once. How can you ever get tired of a classic?  Nigerian artistes have produced few classics over the years like Fela's Lady n BONN, Sonny Okosun's 'Which Way Nigeria' and Mike Okri's 'Omoge'. 2Face's 'African Queen', Sunny Nneji's 'Oruka' and Styl-Plus's 'Olufunmi' are the best songs to have come out of Nigeria in this millennium.  From your blog, I know you are more disposed to rap music, so would you rather one of Nigerian Rap Songs be rated on same level with these songs? Brother, keep it real! Let's hear it for these guys in 2004.
05-5-2005||I'm flattered, what more can I say? But Jio, I hope you know the saying that too much of everything is bad or familiarity breeds contempt. For me, I have to rest 'African Queen', so that when I listen to it again in the next two/three months it'll be music to my ears once again.
05-5-2005||I want to be able to listen to the 2face songs on my account.
17-5-2005|m|Odunayo, to play 'African Queen' on your PC right now, just go to the official website and wait for 5-25 minutes depending on the speed of your Internet connection, and you will hear the song on your PC.  We're working on making it possible for our members to listen to Nigerian music from their accounts, but we want to do it in a legal manner, without violating any laws.
19-5-2005|f|Well I do like this song a lot, there is a deep meaning behind those lyrics.  He talks about the beauty of a black women. He is proud of where he comes from an African man, he puts a number of ideas into one song. If someone sang that to me it would at least put a smile on my face.  Would you rather him sing about a tall blonde women, or something meaningless. I mean girls are always complaining of how unromantic guys can be. There are so many different angles to look at this song, I could strip it of every layer but that would take forever.  Everyone interpret it as you like and find you own individual meaning. I am sure that everyone can relate to it in some shape or form.
23-5-2005|m|Hi Am Omobolanle, am new to the site/forum, am really impressed. Talking about African Queen, whatever popularity or rating the song is getting now is well deserve. The song is a true reflection of the African beauty - the lyrics, the composition everything about it. To my man Tuface - please dont stop what you doing, the sky is the limit - na grammies I dey expect u to go get now cos nothing dey happen and we are 4geda One love
24-5-2005||Hi , I am physpamac and new in this forum. talking about about african queen, I think 2face has done something wonderful. He has served as an eye uponer to most of us and today, I must say that I am proud for I know our ladies are all queens and should be treated as such.  2Face's voice is so thrilling and all I ahve to say is for him to keep making proud .  I am always touched and marked each time I listen to African Queen.  Thanks for doing what you do.
24-5-2005|f|Yes, yes, yes! The song is [I]too[/I] overated!
08-6-2005|f|hey my nigerian singer are 2 face and i might also consider styleplus there are good and that is the real thing about them i love thm so much
08-6-2005|f|WOW i heard this song n i fell in love with it!!! like i said before this song deserves an award!!! nah many awards!!! why can't men be more like that and cherish women that way (of course we will do the same too) reciprocal?!!
08-6-2005||I loved the song the first time i heard it, but when i heard the whole album, personally , i feel there are songs on it. All in all, he rocks!
20-6-2005|f|I think the guy is kinda cute.
20-6-2005|f|this is how i am too, i mite like the song alot but i can never keep listening to it .........i will need a big rest so it wil be music to my ears after sometime...as long as i don't know the wordings of a song, i will keep listening & enjoying it but from day 1 i know the lyrics, that's bye bye to the song
20-6-2005|f|& then.. that African queen in the video is his sister, aint she very pretty with her hair cut?
22-6-2005|f|hmm, african queen. Good good. But oh me gosh, have y'all seen how american kids are crazy about, Call my name by styl plus. The song is all english and they love it so much. this Nigeria guy has sold alot of their copies. and i know so many white folks and african americans that love it. Call my name is tha bomb.

04-4-2005|f|Re: For Catholic Faithfuls The Vatican announced that John Paul died at 21:37 local time Saturday, April 2, after a long struggle against debilitating illness. He was 84 (Yahoo News). He will be buried on Friday this week/  Do you think in 20 days time, a new Pope will emerge from Nigeria? Some friends of mine said its impossible, that they will kill him! What if the New Pope turns out to be Cardinal Arinze or Okogie? What are the implications for Nigeria?
05-4-2005|m|Re: For Catholic Faithfuls Though I am a Muslim, but notwithstanding, this is a man who has touched so many live across the globe and he deserves to be commended.  I as a person who feel great if Cardinal Francis Arinze can become the next Pope. Cardinal Okogie, though, is out of race, because we are talking of senior Cardinals.  Glory to Jesus, Honour to Mary.
05-4-2005|m|"It was an expression of pity and sorrow in Parishes of Catholic Church across Lagos State as officiating priests announced to the congregation the demise of the head of the church. Pope John Paul II, passed on at 9.37pm last Saturday after three days of intense battle with life." - Sun News Online
06-4-2005|f|News reports from CNN yesterday, says there is a high chance Cardinal Arinze emerging as the next Pope, when he was interviewed about it, his response was 'the holy Ghost will decide' , report also says he has served in the Vatican for 20 years, and was very close to the late Pope.
06-4-2005|f|To all Catholic faithfuls and indeed to the world at large, accept my heartfelt condolences on the demise of a great man of God. May his toil and turmoil here on earth be adequately rewarded in heaven.  Having said that, I've maintained the view that rather than mourn, Catholics should actually celebrate the late Pope's life and achievements. He was a man who like Apostle Paul, his namesake, can adequately say 'I have fought the good fight'. If anyone finished their duties on earth, I would say it was him. So, celebration of Life for him really.  It's common knowledge that 3 people are being considered for the next Pope and one of them is from Nigeria. It's a great task being a Pope. We are in the 21st century and all of that, this is religion we're talking about as well and I'll be one of the happiest people should the next Pope emerge from Nigeria but I'll also be one of the most amazed people. Some people will die rather than vote in a black Pope. It's pathetic really to be judged and crucified by your skin colour, but it's the sick world we live in. If it can even become debatable whether priests are allowed to be gay or not and be 'joined' in the Anglican Diocese, a hot debate over a black Pope will definitely ensue. Sad, but true.

06-4-2005|m|The National Broadcasting Corporation (NBC) placed a ban on the broadcasting of unverified miracles on TV (and radio) stations in Nigeria. Here are some views from people featured in the Sun News Online, our preferred online newspaper:  [I]"Let me say this, I have always believed that the remedy to wrong use is not non-use but right use. This ban is working for us because the former attraction to come to the Lord through miracles, had its own plus and minus. People should come to God not just because of miracles. They should come to church because they love God."[/I] Christian Ikechukwu Philips  [I]"It is difficult for me to comment on this area. I have always given God the honour of being the judge. As a Christian, the Bible is the basis, and we must take cognizance of the fact that not all that call the name of the Lord will enter the kingdom of God. The devil himself has been known to showcase some miracles too. So we have to be careful not to be carried away."[/I] Thomas Audu  [I]"Government cant really ban miracles. I think they are just wasting their time. That is just wasting time because such ban is despising Christianity. It is something that any government should be careful about. I think the government has got more to do than to get itself involved in matters like that. This is an issue that transcends laboratory test. It is the recipient that knows what he has gotten."[/I] Rev Felix Meduoye  [I]"They (those who made the order banning miracles on TV) are talking like human beings. But what I think should happen is to allow them to run but if you dont want to hear them, you can shut off your set. What it will result in is that we will go across the borders to Benin Republic, our neighbours, one hour drive from here, open stations and do whatever we want to do. They cant stop that. I dont think what they are trying to do is good for Christianity. I am sure the NBC order will be short-lived. We can go to Benin Republic and do what we are doing."[/I] Pastor (Dr) Francis Ade Jimoh Titus  [I]"I welcomed it. The question is miracle at whose instance. Everything is all set before the cameras. Nigeria is the only country I see miracle happen instantly. If you go to civilized countries you wont see this. That is another extreme because they have conquered the environment. I welcome the ban, it is not a mark of true religion but false utopia. I didnt say that I dont believe in miracles. I do. My existence itself is a miracle."[/I] Father Gabriel Osu  [I]"Although, it is very difficult to ban miracles as they are act of God not human, it is still very important to know that governmen[/b]t in its own wisdom [b]is trying to save the church from ridicule and mockery as a lot of things are being shown on TV today in form of miracles. So, if government can regulate it, it will be a most welcome development. But government must be honest with the way it handles the matter."[/I] Pastor (Prof.) S.O. Ewuola  [I]"Honestly, I dont believe in those TV miracles because I believe its all lies and crap. I think people should stop taking advantage of people. I pray (to God) and He answers me."[/I] Chief (Mrs). Olutomi Taiwo Adeife  [I]"The Bible is being confirmed that the system of things are being dominated by the god of this world and remember the god of this world has a set standard in all things. The banning of miracles on television must not be seen as persecution against Christ and His followers. But I must say it is a declaration of test of reality. If your miracles are banned on television and you know that you are indeed ordained by Christ, why must you cry over that? Why must you even make noise over it? [/b]Why must you disturb the world about it?"[/I] Prophet Solomon Ozi David  [I]"The government, hear me, has no right to ban miracle broadcasting in the country, just because the government has controlling influence or control on these organs of broadcasting. The government can stop the ministers of God from advertising such miracles on Television and Radio [b]but the government can never stop miracles from happening even in the church on a regular basis because we believe in Christ, we believe in the God of miracles, and his children need these miracles in their lives."[/I] Rev (Dr) Chris Lamar  [I]"Jesus did miracles while he was here on earth and there are miracles everyday. But not all those miracles we see on television. In fact, I thank President Obasanjo for banning miracles on television. Miracles happen everyday. The fact that you wake up in the morning hale and hearty is a miracle."[/I] Monsignor Livinus Uka  [I]"There should not be a blanket clampdown. Not all these miracles are fakes. Not all of them are genuine either. So, we should exercise caution. Unfortunately, we cannot carry out any laboratory experiment to determine the authenticity of any claim to miracle but, by their fruit, you shall know them', that is what the Bible says. Miracle is part and parcel of Christianity. But some people have turned it into black magic, deceiving people thereby. We don't need to advertise miracle. Each time Jesus performed any miracle, he would tell the person, "Don't tell anybody,' or 'Go and show yourself to certain people.'"[/I] Archbishop Sunday Ola Makinde  [I]"I dont like the craze for miracles. As APCON chairman, I have always been an advocate of placing a ban on miracle marketing. Oh yes. So I support absolutely what the Nigeria Broadcasting Commission is doing (banning miracle preaching on television)."[/I] Chief Olu Falomo  [I]"I have to be honest with you, there are real miracles of God and there are fake miracles of Satan. If you are a Bible believer, you should be conversant with the story of Moses in Egypt. By the power of God, he did so many things and the magicians of Pharaoh did almost the same thing. But the power of God proved to be superior. What we see today is not the finger of God."[/I] Reverend John Ogu  [I]"There are several areas to look at the problem. If you preach and you say people get healed immediately, you must be able to verify that actually the person being healed was actually sick before. Journalists should actually do investigative job. Go out and investigate these preachers and if you find out that what they claim to have done is fake, expose them.If NBC says dont preach miracles, then they have violated our religious rights. And this we will not take from NBC."[/I] Evangelist Matthew Owojaiye  [I]"A situation whereby you promote only miracle and you dont preach and teach the word, it is not complete , I will also like to use this forum to ask NBC to look into other areas because it is very easy to clamp down on religious activities while there are many other activities that are corrupting and polluting our children. If they must ban miracles, they should also look into some advertisements like alcohol, films, cigarettes and movies that are beyond the level of children."[/I] Evangelist Vero Enewa Aluma  [I]"Television is even the best place to disgrace the fake miracle merchants. If is a matter of time. If they are deceiving people, they will be discovered one day and be disgraced out. The ban on miracle workers should not be. I think they should be left to disgrace themselves the more."[/I] Rev. Henry Olufemi Awoniyi  [I]"I know that anything that has original also has fake. The ban has its advantages and disadvantages. With or without the ban, people must be saved. If the miracles are real, it will be good to encourage people, if fake, then God will disgrace the miracle performers. The ban is a way to control things. People now see miracle as the easiest way to reach God. If you go to this place, you will receive miracles. Nobody tries to know if the miracle is coming from God or not. The ban is good so people will seek God instead of miracles."[/I] Evangelist John Nkwocha  And, finally this insightful observation:: [I]"It is not a ban on miracle; rather it is a ban on the misuse of miracles. That is my own interpretation. Miracles belong to God. It is only God alone that can perform miracle. But the way it is being performed, that is the reason for the ban and no man can manipulate it."[/I] Rev. Mba Idika  You have read what other people think. So what do [I]you[/I] think?
13-4-2005|m|This is a matter than must be carefully commented on.  Personally, I don't watch those miracle workers on the tv, I prefer listening to solid sermons than some acting showmanship. But at the same time, as a christian, I know one way or the other, God is using the ministries of these miracle workers to bring some souls to His kingdom. I must also point out that some of this miracles being showcased on the tv may be fraudulent.  It is not for the NCC to ban miracles, less they become an instrument in the hand of Anti-Christs to hinder the spread of the gospel. Soon, they might completely banish preaching on the air. They can be used against the chrisitian religion.  There are worse things to banish on the air other than miracles. They should look into this. Though, the banning will bring some sanity into preaching on the tv, which is highly welcomed in order to checkmate fraudulent ministers, but my fear is, one day, NCC may wake up and totally ban preaching on the tvs.
17-4-2005|f|i do believe in miracle no doubt about that but i think that a lot of people in nigeria are just using religion as a form of business. it is all for money gains. it is juat sad that a lot of these bad apples are also corrupting the image of the few good people. i mean i do believe in miracle but when i have seen a lot of these fakes when i do see something that might seem real, i have my doubts believeing in it. so i think that was a good call by the gov to take those show off the tv. a man of GOD should not only be oraising GOD so that people would be like he is a good person even if they are genuine, removing them from the screen should not affect their faith and practise. it is only hypocrasy if we only go in public to celebrate the gosple or good news so that people would be like yeah we r good people.
06-7-2005|m|Miracle is good I belief in miracles because I belief in God. Banning unverified Miracles is good but we must be care with it. You will see that the Churches have started having their own private stations on cables.
09-9-2005|m|Why did these pastors decide to stop broadcasting their TV miracles instead of employing reputable doctors to verify their miracles?
09-9-2005|m|I personally don't believe in miracles,but i rely on them
14-9-2005|m|It is a terrible deceptive scheme of Satan that's slowly finding it's way into our nation and which I think if not taken care of will soon evade and eventually sweep away the tenets of this Glorious gospel of our Lord Jesus which have been handed down to us by the Holy Spirit and which we hold so dearly as individuals and as a nation.  We should not let the same evil which evaded the church in Rome where the state ran the church (during the dark ages) and also which is causing the moral decadence in USA and Europe where (as in the US) it is now a crime to make school children say prayers in public.  "Ah is that possible in Nigeria?" u may exclaim....Well who would have thought that in our Nation today where we claim to operate a democry, the government can decide to clamp down on Television Programs/stations which show-case miracles saying that they are "Unverifiable & Unbelievable". Also on their list of offensive programs are those that show large crowds and people falling under the Power of the Holy Spirit.  "Ah that has to so with Pastor Chris and Christ Embassy" u may again exclaim. Certain christians in Nigeria...even so called penticostals cheered the Government on as they continued whith their antichrist-inspired campaign.  Like Paul will say "Who has bewitched u" that u should not believe in the Power of This Glorious Gospel of our Lord enough to Contend for it!  These same set of christians were in shock at the discussions on talk-shows not too long ago held by govt officials and agencies advocating for the institution of 'CHURCH TAX'....On the grounds that the churches make a lot of money and therfore should be taxed. Now how does that sound?  U must understand that when you see the devil showing up and you do not bind him but allow him to take a step...he will on his own take three. This is not about one church or group of churches...it is about our faith. The bible says we should earnestly contend for the fatih which was hande down to us . Do not take this Liberty which we have in our nation for granted. You wouldn't know its value until you loose it.  Where is the Freedom of Expression & Worship which we claim to have through our constitution? This is an infringement on our rights, not only as Nigerians, but as Christians. THIS IS TERRORISM!  Its about time we as christians RISE UP and PRAY, CONTEND, FIGHT and SPEAK OUT for the faith of this glorious gospel of our Lord and resist any attempt by the Devil...whether in the form of a Law or decree of government or by manipulations from religious groups of any sort to steal this Liberty that we have in Christ Jesus.  The devil has not changed ....he raised persecution against Jesus, Paul, Peter, John and the rest of the Apostles for the same reasons. He is still doing the same things today...we shoudn't let him have his way in our nation...let us save this nation and preserve this gospel for our children.  Who knows... today it is miracles and church tax...tommorow it could be that government would recommend what kind of bibles to read and preach from.  WAKE UP AND ACT NOW!
14-9-2005|m|THE UNPARDONNABLE SIN  It is a show.... an occult practiceblack magic The miracles are stage-managed.They are fakedunverifiabledeceiving the people Statements such as these can only come from the lips of one who is accursed and headed for destruction. The things of God are not to be used for jesting or spoken of carelessly. Jesus warned in Mathew 12:31-32 that  the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgivenneither in this world nor in the world to come.  It is important to note that this warning was given by the Jesus in response to the criticism of the Pharisees who attributed a work of healing performed by the Master to devils (Mathew 12:22-24). Unfortunately many of those who criticize miracles today are Christians who claim to know God just as the Pharisees did.  The same warning still applies today for all those who want to make mockery of the acts of God whether Christian or non-Christian. You may say,  I am not a church person, well find out what the judgement of God upon an unchurched person could be like in Acts 13:6-11. The bible tells us that the destruction of the transgressor and the sinner shall be together therefore the Holy Spirit stands to resist and fight against anyone who calls his/herself a Christian and yet stands to speak blasphemy against His work ( Isiah 63:8-10). Desist from speaking evil concerning things of the Spirit of God which you do not understand rather ask God for understanding.  The Lord Jesus is not dead but alive and is still doing what he did in bible days through the hands of those who believe and even greater things for he had said, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do As you can see, these works have already been spoken of in the Holy scriptures. The world would definitely see more of these mighty works of our Lord Jesus Christ demonstrated through His precious saints who continually reveal Gods Love to our hurting world and no man, demon, angel or authority in heaven, on earth or underneath the earth can stand against this move of God in these last days.  The judgement of God will surely visit the house of any and everyone who calls what He is doing a mere magic trick or advertisement. Whether NBC or no NBC, the same anointing that opens blind eyes, unstops deaf ears and heals the cripple will turn around and become the enemy of such folks, frustrating their lives regardless of how much they pray. The miracles of Jesus have never and can never be (throughout the church age) subject to the verification of man. The testifiers of these miracles themselves are the ones to be sought after if any such verification is to be done. Therefore we will never bring insult to the all-powerful Name of Jesus by subjecting His mighty works to the verification of man before they are published.  Therefore, I consider this recent move by NBC to ban Christian miracle programs an action against Almighty God and not just miracle preachers. They should therefore be prepared to inherit the diseases, sicknesses, pains, sufferings and poverty of millions who have put their hopes on God-inspired and anointed TV programs such as Atmosphere for Miracles by Pastor Chris which bring the presence and salvation of God to them in their homes.  Be wise and GET OUT OF THE WRATH!  Ayiranor Wogar
14-9-2005|m|Well said Donnie. I just pity Christians who support this ban. Who is NBC to ban the showing of Miracles. Peolple have the right not to watch. I believe in Miracles simply because i believe in GOD. I have personally been healed through such broadcast and it pains me that someone somewhere would say they are unverified.  Truth is the NBC just doesnt want miracles aired again. Its just an excuse that they are unverified. What stops the NBC from verifyin the Miracles themselves.  I'm angry beyond words ..not that the NBC is bannin such but that the Christian body supports it. Believe me christianity without Miracles is no christianity.
14-9-2005|m|Point of Correction: NBC and not NCC
15-9-2005|m|Can you then tell me why the preachers decided to stop broadcasting the miracles instead of employing Medical doctors to verify the miracles?
15-9-2005|m|The NBC just doesnt want Miracles aired. I can talk for christ embassy. We've got doctors as part of the healing team. These miracles are verified but the NBC can't just ban TV programmes without givin 1 "flimsy" reason or the other. The Miracles are real. I've seen the lame walk in my presence. I just see it as part of the machinations of evil. But its all good. They've got a wider reach now with their own TV stations.
15-9-2005|m|can i tell u something mr. seun... the preachers did not take the miracles off air immidiately the nbc placed the bann. in actual fact, the bann had been in effect right from 2002 immidiately after the total experienece crusade that rocked the city of lagos in december that year packing out the national stadium. the tv stations continued to show these programs despite querys and threat calls from the nbc. a particular reference can b made to a statement from one of the bosses of the nbc to the management of AIT as published by the september 2004 edition of the national standard news magazine. it was reminding the management of their failure to honour an earlier intruction sent to them and several other stations instructiong them to discontinue airing of these programs ...while making particular reference to the atmosphere for miracles program of pastor chris.  i am also aware that there are times that phone calls have been made to these staions even during the airing of the programs commanding the officer in charge to immidiately discontinue the airing of these programs.  These most recent announcements and futher enforcement of the bann with request for verification came immidiately after the much talked about night of bliss program with pastor chris in the city of port harcourt in febuary 2004 drew a record attendancee of 2.5 million attendance ina single night's event.  THIS IS TERRORISM AND THEY MUST BE STOPED!
15-9-2005|m|in my own opinion, it is either our govt for some obscure political reason is trying to curb the growing influence of such men of god as chris oyakhilome who command so great a followership in order to check 'possible' political power shift( for which these men of God as far as I know them, have no interest) or some fellows (in my own opinion a sect of some so-called penticostals) have fed the presidency with damaging information as regards these great men of God whose growing influence seem to portray them as challenging the status quo.  Anyway, we do not use their own kind of man -made weapons because we trust in the living God who hath said '...i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it'! They have gathered to fall!  thank u.
15-9-2005|m|Why are the people so concerned about fakes and not about the truth. Jesus said let the wheat and the shaft grow together ...at the end, the lord of the harvest will seperate the wheat from the shaft and burn up the shaft wiith fire. So it is not the responsinility of NBC neither is it the responsibility of any preacher or group of preachers.
15-9-2005|m|Nice talk Donnie. The weapons of our warfare are not carnal..but mighty through GOD. Let them try as hard has they can. They can't suppress God word because that word is LIVE (inherent power). Remember what happened in the city of Ephesus.....  [center] (Amplified bible) Thus the Word of the Lord [concerning the attainment through Christ of eternal salvation in the kingdom of God] grew and spread and intensified, prevailing mightily.Acts 19:20[/center]
15-9-2005|m|If u say the miracles are fake , then perform the genuine ones let us see. That is y u see, the more they challenge the power of God , the more broke of the annointing they become.  Anyway, i will suggest u take a look at this site and see if all thier noise about Banning miracles from being aired is worth the trouble: www.loveworldchristiannetwork.net
22-9-2005|m|Where is the proof of the validity of these miracles? Where are the practising doctors who are ready to put their careers on the line to declare that they have seen these people before and after the miracle service and all evidence points to the genuineness of the miracle?  And where is NBC to re-assure us that the reason they have banned these miracle services is for benefit of the masses the and not for some high-ranking person who happens to be a friend of their director?
22-9-2005|m|Listen Mr. Seun,  If you are looking for a proof, i am a living proof. I have experienced a miracle of healing before in a healing crusade of Christ Embassy. Apart from that, I have witnessed a blind man regain his sight in one of Pator Chris' meetings in Port Harcourt. I was a councellor in that meeting and i took record of that particular testimony and refered the man to a doctor for testing(verification). Every one of those miracles you see on TV. have been tested and proved by trained doctors who are part of the healing team. We usually have thousands of doctors, nurses and biochemists in this team.  Listen, don't bother yourself 'because the NBC knows for sure that the miracles are true. That is why up till now, they have not come up with an approved verification body or even a well laid down procedure for verification. They are just acting on instructions.  Common sense can tell u this...the miracles have been on air for several years now and we have not heared of a single case of fraud ...of someone who had been paid money to testify.  I read about a lady who is a senior officer of NBC who said that Nigerian doctors were not trust worthy and as such should not be given the resposibility of verifying these miracles. This woman happened to be the wife of the General Overseer of Four square gospel Church, who was at the time, the vice president of the PFN and also a major supporter of the Ban. So the Churches can't verify, Nigerian doctors are too currupt to verify...So NBC becomes all and all...from prosecutor to "Almighty judge"!  My question for these PFN leaders is this: They believe in Benny Hinn and Renhard Bonke's ministries. Is it easier for them to go to America to verify miracles than to go to the addresses of those we put on TV? Their names and addresses are available. These people have clear identities in Nigeria. Why don't they go there to prove the miracles wrong?  Many of those who are shown on TV have medical certificates to prove their conditions. The NBC could even book for an appointment with the healing school of christ embassy so as to interview the candidates and watch the healing service live.  But they would not do this...they are only interested in carrying out their anti-christ inspiresd campaign. Unfortunately for those christians who are supporters of the bann, they are unaware of the fact that they are dancing to the tune of the Spirit of the Anti-Christ.  Anyone who will say that people should not be given opportunity to say what the Lord has done for them is only voicing the thoughts of demons...many of which have been cast out by these great men of God and are working hard at stopping further destruction of their kingdom. Christians who support this are driven by envy and jealousy and have yielded to the Spirit of the Anti-Christ without knowing.
04-10-2005||you believe in miracles because you believe in God?  So, if I pretend to be sick, have some guy pray over me, then suddenly, i am healed- you will believe because you saw it on tv- because you believe in God? Well, I guess I must say I believe you are an idiot.  I can't speak for the true motivations behind banning "UNVERIFIED" miracles from TV, but I do say I support it 100%. One thing which irks me a lot are people faking being healed or some other miracle.  I think the majority of those who would be against banning unverified miracles are either idiots or those who were faking them.
04-10-2005|m|The day U'll need a miracle in your life...U'll be forced to eat your words. Why insult the guy or call people idiots for their belief...U seem to be parochial.  Just because someone uses an evil power to do miracles does not nullify GODs ability to do Miracles. God loves us. He made us and wouldnt leave us to perish. Reason for Miracles. Salvation itself its a miracle and the fact that u've not experienced it does not stamp its non existence.  Miracle is simply divine intervention in the affairs of humans. I believe in Miracles because i believe in GOD.
04-10-2005||this doesn't make sense!!  So because I don't believe in FALSE miracles - you are saying I don't believe in miracles?  That doesn't make sense!  Or are you saying that when I need a false miracle in my life, I'll be wishing I believed?  Well, if my unbelief in fakes keeps me from being a victim of false miracles - then I'm going to keep it up.
04-10-2005||the topic here is false/unverified/fake miracles.  Your bullishness is making it seem like you are saying this:  I believe in FAKE miracles because I believe in God.  Can you see how people may think that statement to be foolish?
05-10-2005|m|"I believe in Miracles because i believe in GOD". The means nothing else but that i believe Miracles can happen because i believe GOd exists.  There is no such thing as an unverified miracle. If its is not obvious/verified then its not qualified to be called a miracle. the pastor calls it a miracle does not make it a miracle.  Fake signs can be be wrought but they are always obvious. U'll know its fake if ur hearts aint blind.
07-10-2005|m|Kamakula, I will not respond to you because you do not look like someone who is disposed to sound reason....neither will i glorify your comments about me or about miracles by responding to them.
21-10-2005|m|Exactly. And Donnie y dont these 'miracle workers' ever heal confirmed AIDS patients
24-10-2005|m|Sage,  Please do not join the camp of those who talk out of ignorance. Who told you that there have not been cases of confirmed Aids patients being heald. There have been several of such cases, too numerous to mention. With certificates confirming their situations before and after their healings.  In the local church where i worship, we have living testimonies of people who have been heald of full blown AIDS! One of the beneficiaries of this miracle working power of God is my personal friend. In case you do not realise, what you you are questioning is not just the genuinness of these men of God, but the ability of God to cure AIDS.  I challenge you, if you have any such case, to go online and book an appointment for your him/her with the healing school of Christembassy and experience God's miraculous power for yourself. www.christembassyhealingschool.org  The victim of AIDS does not even need to see the man of God if He is Born-again and filled with the Holy Spirit... and if he/ she can fully comprehend and appropriate God's Word in his/her life... allowing the Word to produce results in his/her body!  Rom. 8:11 "And if the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead is living in you, he who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit, who lives in you. "
24-10-2005|m|My own mother got healed and since that experience, she has been living healthy. What more do you want as proof?
26-10-2005|m|
26-10-2005|m|A whole load of still more unverified stories. 'Testimonies' they call it. Let them save the thousands dying of AIDS who are in diffrent AIDS centers and stop giving us 'testimonies'  One thing i don't like hearing is somebody saying that asking 4 proof is testing God. That is a crap used to misled ignorant ones. And dont tell me Christ did this and that.
26-10-2005|m|Just like Thomas you are saying, "Unless I see in his hands the print of the nails, and place my finger in the mark of the nails, and place my hand in his side, I will not believe." (Jn 20:25)  When you need a miracle, you will believe...you will look for me. Many others have said worse things. But by the time the doctors gave them up to die, they searched desperately for someone who believed in miracles to help them.  Like Jesus i have this to say, "Have you believed because you have seen me? Blessed are those who have not seen and yet believe." (Jn 20:29)
06-12-2005||It pains me when people expose their ignorance in public without any desire tolearn. Their mind is made up and they just refuse to see reason even in the light of the Word. Let any one that want to verify anything carry a patient who is certified sick by any hospital of your choice. Register him with the Christ Embasy Healing School (ofcourse that is done with medical record only) and then get the same doctors and lab scientists to conduct their tests after Pastor Chris would have ministered to the sick man. If nothing happens, you can them talk out of knowledge not ignorance. Wisodm is profitable to direct. As for the ban, why have they not banned all the other things that glorify the kingdom of darkness. What of the obscenities that have crept into the home videos? And if I may ask: Who made NBC the discerner of Spiritual Verities?? Dear Christians, who has bewitched you? Have you started in the spirit ans now want to continue in the flesh? Where is the gift of discernment? And even if there is anything false or fake in the miracles (if that is the result of your discernment), did your Lord, Master and Employer not say that the wheat should be allowed to grow with the tares? Are you now wiser than Him?? Did He not say that you will do greater works than He did?? And when He came to the pool of Bethsaida, did He heal all the sick or just the crippled man?? Please ask yourself some honest questions and let the Spirit of god guide you, lest you become the ignorant and zealous Saul(Paul) that kicked against the pricks in his bid to serve and work for God. Shalom!

06-4-2005|f|Only one person did all that? I've not been able to watch the news! Thanks for the info
06-4-2005|m|This is cool, Seun. How did you managed to type all these? Anyway, thanks for the info. I am pasting them to Microsoft Word and read them later tonight. This Tafa guy is in a serious trouble.
06-4-2005|m|Hope this would serve as a lesson to others, who believes that Nigeria money belong to their hierachy. Kudos to Aremu.
07-4-2005|m|Now that the heads have started rolling, it will continue to roll. I believe OBJ wants to use his remaining tenure to endear himself to Nigerians, since this is his last chance to govern this country.  I wish him God's protection and divine wisdom in his campaign to clean the augean stable of this nation.
13-4-2005||This is interesting. This man has killed his unborn generation. Na wa oh!
13-4-2005|f|There is hope for us yet as a nation. Although, cynical as it might paint me, I cannot but wonder what became of the findings of Oputa Panel and where all the millions recalled from the Abubakar, Abacha's family and the rest ended up. I might be far behind in my politics update but I don't recall the money been put to any positive use, if any save for fattening other people's already obessed Swiss acounts.
26-4-2005|f|The 'big guy' has been granted bail. I didn't think he would scale through, with the stringent bail conditions given him by the judge. I am dying to know who his surelties are.
27-4-2005|m|List of bail conditions:[list][li]Production of two eminent persons as sureties in the sum of N50 million each who shall be holders of the national honours not below GCON and who shall be landed property owners within Asokoro or Maitama of the Federal Capital Territory, title documents of which shall be deposited with the court.[/li][li]As further guarantee, the accused shall produce four traditional title holders of first class ranking reflecting a geographical spread of the country[/li][li]The accused shall report weekly to the nearest EFCC office to him and the accused shall surrender all his travel documents including all international passports to the court.[/li][/list]
02-5-2005|m|Wow! 80% of Nigerians feel that the arrest of Inspector General Tafa Balogun is a genuine act against corruption by the EFCC, and not:[list][li]Personal vendetta by Nuhu Ribadu[/li][li]Motivated by an ethnic agenda, or[/li][li]Motivated by a political agenda[/li][/list]You can add your vote to this poll.
03-5-2005|m|The should not be shown no mercy, let him go to jail, shame to him and the rest who has not been cuaght.
03-5-2005|m|Man, that was a hell of accusation to be made against one man. I guess not from the days of Al Capone the Chicago crime boss has such been made.  But what has not ceased to surprise me is the relative ease with which Tafa Balogun was able to secure bail. despite the "overly" stringent terms. Also the court conspiracy not to let us know his "bailers" smacks of something like the "big boys" connections at work.  Its all good, this is Nigeria.
09-8-2005|m|It smacks of selective justice to me! What happened to Chris Uba? The killers of Bola Ige, etcetera? The people that failed to appear before Oputa Panel? The disobedience to the Supreme Court judgments by the Federal Government , Re Lagos State VS FGN. The Rigging of the last general Election by PDP ,with the full support of the Nigerian Police under the leadership of this same Tafa man , BEING DRAGGED IN THE MUD today. The list is endless.
11-8-2005|m|Tragedy has struck at Elere area of Lagos State after a Police corporal shot his constable colleague dead following a heated argument over the sharing of bribe collected from motorists. However, Police authorities in the state said the shooting was an accidental discharge when the policemen were playing with a cup of tea.  The shooting which reportedly occurred at a beer parlour where the policemen were drinking, sent other customers scampering for safety to avoid being hit by stray bullets. Some of the panic-stricken customers reportedly sustained injuries as they ran in different directions.  The policemen (names withheld) had gone out, Sunday, on a stop-and-search operation around the area between 9a.m and noon, after which they went to a beer parlour to share their proceeds. The corporal was said to have given the constable an undisclosed amount which he (the constable) refused, arguing that it was far below what the corporal took. A hot argument soon ensued.  Apparently seeing the attitude of the constable as an affront, the corporal allegedly shot him at close range and left him in the pool of his own blood.  However, Police authorities in Lagos described the shooting as an accidental discharge. Police spokesperson, Mr Olubode Ojajuni, said the two policemen were playing with a cup of tea as friends when the rifle which the corporal was carrying went off and hit the constable. "We are already investigating what really happened and at the end of the day if we find the corporal wanting, we will charge him with negligence because he was trained on how to handle guns," he said.
11-8-2005|f|Ha! Only one person with 45-count charges. The man deserves to be hanged! He is worse than all the thieves they normally burn to ashes in Lagos. OLE!
09-1-2007||that man deserves to die by hanging,it will be a great shame if that man will go away without charged
09-1-2007|m|I think he should change his name to: Tafa Ibanujebaole Balogun

06-4-2005|f|Lyrics to "Sweet Mother" Hey guys, I was just wondering if anyone knows the lyrics to 'Sweet Mother'. It is a pretty old song; I guess it was around in the fifties. If you do, please hook me up! I loved the song!
06-4-2005|m|Sweet Mother Sweet mother I no go forget you for the suffer wey you suffer for me.  Sweet mother I no go forget you for the suffer wey you suffer for me.  When I dey cry, my mother go carry me--she go say, 'my pikin', wetin you dey cry ye, ye, stop stop, stop stop make you no cry again oh."  When I won sleep, my mother go pet me, she go lie me well well for bed, she cover me cloth, sing me to sleep, "sleep sleep my pikin oh."  When I dey hungry, my mother go run up and down. she go find me something when I go chop oh.  Sweet mother I no go forget you for the suffer wey you suffer for me  When I dey sick, my mother go cry, cry, cry, she go say instead when I go die make she die.  O, she go beg God, "God help me, God help, my pikin oh."  If I no sleep, my mother no go sleep, if I no chop, my mother no go chop, she no dey tire oh.  Sweet mother I no go forget you, for the suffer wey you suffer for me.  You fit get another wife, you fit get another husband, but you fit get another mother? No!  And if I forget you, therefore I forget my life and the air I breathe.  And then on to you men, forget, verily, forget your mother, for if you forget your mother you've lost your life.  Listen

28-4-2005|f|Very sweet indeed. But I guess she'll appreciate it better if you were to get an artist to write out the words on a plain card for you. That way it looks more personal. Just a suggestion.  I particularly like the song myself and just yesterday had a rather interesting conversation with a friend about it.......
14-7-2005|f|my own sweet mother song goes like this.  1, Who sat and watch my infant heads, when sleeping on my candel bed, and pray to God that I should not die, My mother......  2, When pains, and sickness mades me to cry, who gazy upon my heavy eyes, and weep for fear tht I should die, My mother.  Enjoy.

My Mother.  When sleep forsook my open eye, Who was it sung sweet hushaby, And rock'd me that I should not cry? My Mother.  Who sat and watch'd my infant head, When sleeping on my cradle bed, And tears of sweet affection shed? My Mother.  When pain and sickness made me cry, Who gaz'd upon my heavy eye, And wept, for fear that I should die? My Mother.  Who drest my doll in clothes so gay, And taught me pretty how to play, And minded all I had to say? My Mother.  Who ran to help me when I fell, And would some pretty story tell, Or kiss the place to make it well? My Mother.  Who taught my infant lips to pray, And love God's holy book and day, And walk in wisdom's pleasant way? My Mother.  And can I ever cease to be Affectionate and kind to thee, Who wast so very kind to me, My Mother.  Ah! no, the thought I cannot bear; And if God please my life to spare, I hope I shall reward thy care, My Mother.  When thou art feeble, old, and gray, My healthy arm shall be thy stay, And I will soothe thy pains away, My Mother.  And when I see thee hang thy head, 'Twill be my turn to watch thy bed, And tears of sweet affection shed, My Mother.  For God, who lives above the skies, Would look with vengeance in His eyes, If I should ever dare despise, My Mother.

07-4-2005|f|Ok, imagine this situation. You are in love with this person, but you know that there are lots of sexually transmitted or other diseases around, and you know it is the right thing to make sure that you are not going to have any complications later on, that if you planned to end up with the person. Ok, the best thing to do is to go for testing.  So you both go for that and then you find out that you are both not compatible, because if you get married maybe there would be some stuff wrong with the child or other complication. Should you break off and call off the relationship? Do you think that you should even go for the testing? And when do you think is the right time to do that?  Ok, maybe not sexually transmitted dieases but hereditary ones (because I know that making a decision concerning a sexually transmitted disease would not be all that difficult). Your opinions?
10-4-2005|f|Hereditary diseases are diseases that are genetically transmitted, i.e. from one generation to the other. The most prominent and common, at least in Africa, of these diseases would be the sickle cell anaemia disease and I think I'm right in assuming that this is what you're talking about Chigszy?  To avoid birthing a sickler (as we call them in Nigeria), it means that a couple must ensure that they both are not carriers of the Sickle Cell blood type. For example it is not advisable for a guy whose blood group is AS to get married to another AS. Their chances of having a child who is a sickler are really very high 1:3. In some cases in fact all the kids are Sickle cell anaemia disease carriers. I had a cousin who was a sickler, lost him barely 2 years ago; I have a very close friend who is also a sickler (he is married with a child now, thank God). I also have a niece who is also an SS. It is not the best of experiences for both the parents and the child concerned. Some are luckier than some but for the majority who are visited by constant attacks, it is really very gutting. My heart (I dont say that lightly at all) goes out always to people in this condition by absolutely no fault of theirs.  As advisable as it is to be sure that your partner while courting is not AS (if you yourself are AS) how do you ask this question of a guy in your first few dates without appearing too pushy? Be that as it may, should this be discovered at the latter stage of your relationship, while preparing for marriage, what do you do? Call it quits? There's no straight forward answer really. If anyone finds themselves in such a situation, as harrowing as it might be, the decision remains totally with the couple in question. To be on the safest side however, it is advisable that someone who is AS as I am, marries a guy who is AA.  Having said that, whatever anyone decides to do in this situation, I strongly believe that their faith shall surely make them whole.  About sexually transmitted diseases (STD), well, there's only one way to go isn't there, out! More so if the STD was brought about by the victim's promiscuity.
10-4-2005|m|Well all i have to say is better be safe than sorry. When you are dating a lady or guy (whichever implies), thats is normal dating which probably is due to plain attraction or maybe crush etc, and does not really have anything to do with anything like future proposals to marriage , testings is really uncalled for, i would say just play safe. Even if you happen to be promiscuous, so to speak, make sure you protect yourself. Forget that he or she may also be protecting himself or herself.  Now the moment he or she proposes, which is the later most of the time as in the guy proposing, Drag him for a test before you even think about saying a Yes, Not only test for sickle cell Anaemia, you can do various test for STDS, HIV, and even Fertility and maybe sperm counts for men, if you are thinking of having babies (some are not . You might think its way too outrageous to ask for such tests. But frankly you would be glad you did.  You wouldn't want to be married, and then start regretting and blaming yourself for every single occurrences that comes into existence later on. If you want a happy married life, please do the test, before even saying yes.
11-4-2005|m|As regards hereditary diseases, I think Ra has beautifully analysed everything.  Some churches now has made it complusory for intending couples to do medical tests prior to their being joined together. These tests includes Sickle Cell Anaemia, HIV, and other sexually transmitted diseases. And these they must do at any of the church's specified medical centres. This is because the church wants to avoid joining two AS together, as analysed by Ra. And if the couple insists after being educated as to their situation, then they can be joined together at their own risks. At least, they have been informed.  As regarded HIV, definitely, there will be no joining. It is too risky to do that.  Personally, I won't advise an AS to get married to another AS. This is because the chance of their having sickler children is quite high. It is not a light thing to have a sickler in the family. It will drain the joy and finances of such families concerned. And at the end, the sickler may still die.  When a man and a woman are in a relationship that is tending to marriage, it is better for both of them to go for tests as soon as the issue of marriage comes up. This will enable them to use their commonsense where the results of the tests proved unfavourable, before their emotions take control if they delay the tests.
22-4-2005|f|whereas hereditary diseases have been clearly spelt out, here's my piece on what i think. One important issue that intending couples who are both AS have to consider is the psychological and emotional effect of the disease on their children. The agony that SS children go through is one that no one will like to cope with and that is why intending couples are not to let emotions or sentiments make them ignore the importance of genotype grouping. Many SS children have known to grow up hating their parents for having caused them this pain and constant hospitalization. Also, many people avoid marrying those that have SS irrespective of their blood genotype cos of their vulnerability.  However, I feel, when two people with AS genotype decide to marry, both must be convinced that GOD approves of their relationship and both MUST have FAITH. If there is any fear about the possibility of having SS children, then DO NOT go into the marriage because it will take a miracle to have only AA or AS children and without faith you cannot get your miracle. Futhermore, there should be parental and also pastoral consent cos the support they would give cannot be overemphasised.
22-4-2005|m|I'm surprised that nobody has mentioned birth control as an option. (perhaps we see marriage primarily as a way to get children). If two sickle cell carriers decide to get married then maybe they should just make up their minds to adopt. The "love, love, love" that is there today and gone tommorrow is probably not worth the potential pain
22-4-2005|f|Dear Seun, erm ... I think it's time you gave me your number. We seem to have a lot to discuss about relationship, marriage and the things that go on behind closed doors ... Your thoughts about these things are refreshingly innocent, bless you.
05-5-2005|f|Still on hereditary diseases and marriage, the other day, I heard the president of the sickle cell association of Nigeria say over the radio that for every 4 Nigerians, 1 has the sickle cell triat. At this rate , future generations would have this sickle cell trait and eventually sufferers I.e if nothing is done about this. One thing we can do is to know our genotypes and the genotype of whomever we intend to marry, so that this catastrophe will not befall our Children and Children's children.
08-6-2005|f|well its ok for u all to talk but i think we should talk about issues we are really familiar with i have an aunt in abuja who happens to be the oldest leaving sickler in her fifties how did she get these lucky u'll say well i think its the grace GOD gave to her.  my elder sister who is in her thirties is also a sickler and how did they go about it b4 marriage,u know its best to be friends b4 u start thinking of moving to the next level,as u become friends u are usually free to ask whatever questions u chose to that way u get to know the other parties genotype and then its left for u to either go ahead trusting that GOD will do a miracle only if u have FAITH if not don't even think about it cos u'll only bring children into the world to suffer not enjoy life and die like so many of my sisters sickler friends did its not wise to gamble with ones health and future
10-6-2005|f|God is the creator of all things. He is aware of the existence of sickle cell anemia and other hereditary diseases. Let us not put God to test and claim we have faith. A man and a woman courting knows when the courtship is smelling of marriage and they should go for medical check up to know if any of them has any form of hereditary disease.  If 'yes', then the curable ones should be taken care of before marriage but the risky one like sickle cell, per adventure two of them as AS, the only solution to it is to surrender.  The love they profess will fail to cover them when the pain arrives. Parents would not be comfortable again because they will always be in the hospital taking care the hospitalized child(ren), in addition to expenses. The child(ren) will regret being born into the world because of the pain sickle cell forces them to pass through.  Or what do you say?
26-6-2005|m|what an issue? Sickle cell anaemia is the one that i am going to talk about here because it touches me personally. and I have done plenty of reading about it. 1) SS is a genotype not a blood group. 2) the others are AA ,AS, (AC & SC) while AA is free of this blood deficiency AS & ACare carriers of the genetic (trait)deficiency while SS & SC are sufferers of the disease. Sickle cell disease is geographically located,it is found along the malaria belts of west africa, north africa & a small part of asia. some scienctist say that it is a natural mutation of the blood to combat malaria as carriers of the sickle cell trait (AS) have more immunity to malaria. I visited a south african health web site www.health24.com and to my surprise the gonecologist whose profile says that she has over 10 years genecology expirence does not know what AS genotype is, she asked me to explain AS that they dont have it in south africa. All available statistics on the ratio of sickler from the marriage between couples who are carriers (AS) are just permutations. I have talked to a 40 year old sickler who is the seventh of eight children & the only sickler. I have met a lady who has four children that are AA even when the lady & her husband are (AS) carriers of the trait. I have a neigbour with 3 son of which 2 are sicklers. I have heard of a couple whose four children are all sicklers.so lets not use statistics either for or against couples with AS marrying. If we say that it is a disease, what is the medical remedy or cure?. for now there is non mainly because it does not affect the whites even when they come to these geographic zones. but it can be managed - how we perceive and react to sicklers in this parts should be changed we should first of know that it is not the sicklers fault if a sickler says he is tired we should accept it as a fact rather than looking down at them as lazy people which leads some of them to suicidal efforts even when they are really bone tired. then parents of sicklers should as much as possible treat them like their normal children but they should also make them aware of their condition which may require special attention being given to them like taking special drugs and food from time to time, the sickler i met says that she has not had a crisis in the last 25 years because of her family's love, her medication&attention to her body needs if she is felling weak or tired she take time off to really rest and feeding. parents should show them love & should try as much as possible not to show this sicklers that they are a burden to their parents. because some of the things some parent have said to ther sickling children in anger & frustration are unbelieveable are etched deeply in the minds of this sicklers.the 40 year old sicklerIi mentioned earlier is a cousellor and some of the thing she told me that some sicklers undergo in the hands of their family is harrowing. Placing sickling babies on 125mg of pennicilin per day for the first 5 years of their lives helps to build their immunity & reduces the frequency of their crisis. Why am I so interested? you may want to know,Ii am a carrier (I have AS genotype) and recently when I wanted to move from a short dating period to courtship I found out that the special lady is also a carrier of the trait. the knowledgde is gut twisting.it took a while though to even become rational again and she has still not gotten over the shock we are still consoling each other.(to nip any unnecessary controversy there is a world of difference between dating & courting, dating is when you are going out as friends, geting to know each other while courtship is when the two of you have decided to get married, here both of you can now tell your folk that this is the person I want to marry) If not for the fact that we are both catholics we would have gone ahead with the marriage plans because there is what is called aminocethensis by which couple can detect the genotype of the baby or fetus in the first 2 weeks of its life to decide wether to have the baby or to abort it.
17-1-2006|f|slowpoison, did you breakup with your girlfriend over this? I have a similar problem i am AC and my boy friend is AS. We are at a point where we want to get married but am confused. My boy friend says its up to me its my decision to make. Can u guys give some advise on SC.
26-6-2006|m|I think you should discuss the implications of your marriage with a doctor. AC*AS mating might be ok.  Are you willing to try artificial insemination or adoption? That way, you can still get married to Mr Right.
26-6-2006|f|I think it is often easier to discuss these matters objectively when you are not a concerned party. Truth is, until you wear the shoe, you will NEVER understand just how it pinches. , I mean the shoe as in either be a carrier of such a condition or the parent of the child born with the condition. All I can say here is what I might do in this situationknowing myself , I will not want to risk having a child with this conditionIve never been much of a gambler. If the relationship has gone so far as to be discussing marriage, then we would have to explore our options and adoption would be my first choice.as I dont think Id want to leave Mr. Right it's hard enough to meet him! what if I did and down the road I met Mr. I go manage am and we found I was incapable of having kids? Or that we had and the child had some other inherited condition previously undetected? Story go come get Y-leg,
26-6-2006|m|Better be safe than sorry like someone has said or would you prefer medicine after death. You both know after marriage there are yet alot of issues to settle why not save yourself when you truly can, blood group is just too important, this you must know before marriage. Although its not certain that when 2 AS hook up it would automatically become SS, even though its not worth risking. Nigeria as a nation is not used to adoption or insemination and i sure know its way too easier said than done.  Hereditary Diseases does not have to be sickle cell only, there are quite alot of diseases that hereditary. did i hear you say Asthma can not be hereditary?
26-6-2006|f|Asthma is hereditary!! please  it pitifuly too. imagine you on a date and your girl go freezing in public or in during an exam or even during sex read more   any ways  I guess if you think about the hereditary dieases has a gauge you'll become to choosy for your own good.
27-6-2006|f|Asthma is hereditory as are many others even more serious and debilitating, cystic fibrosis Adoption or insemination might not be wide spread in Nigeria(I wouldn't say they are in Europe either or America, just that people are more open about them), but they are options, just not advertised by those using them, and I assure you it isn't an easy decision by those who decide to go down that route. What about the conditions whereby a pairing is not needed, should you stay away from say someone whose family has a history of , say asthma for eg , (or substitute your own e.g) because you don't want to have asthmatic kids? All I'm saying is , you can't change your genetic makeup, so don't limit your options to only one-coupling with someone who is perfect(as far as you can see/detect)
29-6-2006|m|AS+ AC is just as bad as AS+AS.  AS+AS is the devil's work and must never happen, EVER no matter what your pastor says.  dont do it or you are a murderous creature who does not deserve to be called human.
29-6-2006|m|Darkman what an analysis!
07-4-2005|f|Do you know that today is world Health day. Well it is a day set aside for people worldworld to look into health related issues affecting them. This year Nigeria is focusing on health issues affecting Women and Children, how thoughtful!  So what are these health issues, I can identify Polio, measles and Diphtheria ( AKA The three- killer diesease) for children. Then there is VVF and breast cancer for women.  What other diseases are there?
18-4-2005|m|Sexually Transmited Diseases.
25-7-2007|m|Yes STD.
12-11-2007|m|TB is one of the leading causes of death among people living with AIDS  not only because they're more susceptible to TB, but also because TB can increase the rate at which the AIDS virus replicates. One of the first indications of HIV infection may be the sudden onset of TB  often in a site outside the lungs (extra pulmonary TB).

07-4-2005|f|How do you know that the person you met is the right person for you? Is it the things they do or say? Or the way they present themselves? Or do we just take their beauty and then pray that they are the right people?
08-4-2005|m|Can we ever know the right person? When we look around us, we see happy couples or the so called "Happily Married people" but have we visited their lives? do we know if they are happy or not? you really cant tell.  The right person I would say is not always the right person, if we try to be judgemental about it. This is because emotions and feelings would come in, and judgemens through emotions?. How tangible can it be? Normally emotions blind choices or even our decision in life, and how can we know the right person, when choices like falling in love are governed by such factors?  We cannot run away from it, thats why we have fantasy. we always do !!. My recommendations would be explore reasonable things that comes along, but know when its time to leave. You would sure find the guy , that the exit door is just not there. Destiny does have a huge impact on such choices I believe. Do you believe in Destiny? if you do then you do not have a problem . Just play safe I would say.
08-4-2005|m|Knowing the right person? I think the right question should have been "Are you a right person yourelf?"  The law of "like begets like" reveals that we attract people like us into our lifes.  So maybe the examination should be introspective, then we can learn the secret of who you really are, what you want and how to identify it with, when you see it.  I believe in Faith, and keeping faith with your partner will go along way in giving you a real happy life together.  Not all Roses are Red, and life is not a bed of Roses either.  All the best in your Quest!!
08-4-2005|f|It might be difficult for some, but in my own candid opinion, God - who created you - knows who's best for you and knows whom to give you for a partner. You can never know who's best for you, no matter what you do, I tell you. So why not pray and ask for guidance?
08-4-2005|f|Ok another question. Do you all think that it ok to date many people before you find the right one? Or just find one and hope that one is the one.
09-4-2005|f|Finding or confirming that your partner is the right person is the trickiest thing on earth. It is at the same time very relative. You see, as human beings, the only constant thing in our lives is change. What you fancied or considered the right thing or the right person at a certain age and level pales into insignificance at another. For a jambite (as we call them), the right guy might be any of a lot of guys but as she moves closer to her final days on campus, the story changes entirely. What am I trying to say?  It takes a right person to know who the right person is. Makes any sense? I cannot decide or know my right person even if he sits on my head without me being confident in who I am first and knowing for certain what I desire to see in my ideal guy. Every man/woman who desires meeting and knowing (when they do meet) that this is the right person must first of all mentally (or even physically) draw up the basic qualities and values they want in their partner. For example, do you want a person who is God fearing, someone nice and patient with others as well as you, who cares about the things you care about, someone with the same or even more sense of responsibility, credibility and such things that are important to you? Moving on to the ...well,...vainer side of things, do I want a tall guy (he'd have to be because I'm 5'11'), does he/she have a career he's pursuing, the list is endless really. But one thing I've come to realise over the years is that going out there looking for the right person without being armed with the basic qualities you want in the person when you do find them or they find you, as the case may be, is as good as going on a treasure hunt blindfolded. Whatever your fingers touch will appear to be a treasure even when it's clear to every other clear-sighted person around you that it's nothing but a garbage bin.  Re dating many people before finding the right one, I'ld say some people are lucky first timers. The first person they meet is the right one, my big sister is one of such, verily happily married to her childhood sweetheart for over 8 years now with 3 adorable kids. She was barely 23 when they got married. For others unfortunately, it involves emotional wounds and scares from past relationships gone bad. But if we all know what exactly we want in our partner, even though we are not likely to tick off all the points we want in that right person (for instance, he might be all what you looked out for in a guy but without a dress sense...Help Him!) the good thing about adhering to your list of values and basic qualities is that you know when you meet the wrong person and you save yourself undue stress and months of needless heartache.  Having said all of that however, it's not as easy as it sounds, it boils down to being truthful to yourself and praying to the One who founded the marriage institute to show you your missing rib.
09-4-2005|f|Well said girl!
11-4-2005|f|Appearances they say are deceptive so in knowing who the right person is, you have go down on your knees and ask God for the vision and the foresight in choosing your life partner. And as Ra rightly said, you need to find your missing rib.
11-4-2005|m|I believe that making the right choice in any field of life takes the same process. But I think the problem is that we tend to get foolish when love is involved!  It can take an entrepreneur 2 years to plan the launching of a business (which can be sold off anytime if it's not working). I can take a graduate years to finally find a job worth settling in (and even if you make the wrong choice, you can resign quite easily when you find a better one).  Baased on that observation, one would think that dating/engagement/marriage would be taken with a lot more seriousness (since it is supposed to last 50 - 70 years). One would think people would consult experts and seek knowledge, spend a lot of time evaluating the various options, and stick with the decision once it's made.  Is this how it happens in practice? No. Why not? Because we think love is different.
11-4-2005|f|If I know nothing about marriage or even relationships, I know for certain that no one craves the pain or hurt that inevitably follows a bad marriage or a broken relationship. Silly as it might sound, choosing a partner or matters of the heart are way different from choosing what suit to wear to work or what car to buy next year. Why is it different? If we all knew the answer to that then no one will ever have a sour relationship again. Wont that just be the perfect world! Experience, they say, is the best teacher and it's been proven time and again relationship wise. The major prayer is never to get into the wrong hands or to court the wrong woman. A typical instance, a legal career is a legal career. I did not start off Law Classes in UI under the false impression that I would graduate as a medical doctor. That's the difference. Practical, daily issues will not present themselves to be what they are not. Men and women world over however, are not as simple and uncomplicated.
24-5-2005|m|Hello,  I am a new member in this blog and I hope my stay here would be worth it. Going through your messages lately, I got to know how beautiful you guys think and how innovative we all are. Great Nigerian young adults long live us all!  Well, as for my guy that wants to know how you recognise love, well I guess it has to do a lot with feelings first and the rest latter. I mean, it starts with you feeling something strong about that person and when you get to know the person more you get to see other qualities you like and have always wanted in any girl.  One more thing: In such cases the love never goes wrong, but be watchful o ...
24-6-2005|m|It's a difficult question. However there is a logical answer. You choose the most favourable of the rest if you must: scale of preference.
11-7-2005|m|Well, I think there are "right people". While I was serving, I met a girl whom I was convinced was "the one" (yeah like Neo ). I am very choosy about any girl I want to date cos I feel it has to be a longterm relationship to be worthwhile. From the very first time I met her, I admired her intelligence, her natural altruism and her youth. She was engaged then and I tried to "disengage" her cos I truly believed we were made for one other. didn't work out though and now she is happily married with a kid.  Now if there is a right person, that would mean I'm doomed for good, but I honestly believe that there is that special person that would be as crazy about you as you are about him/her.
15-10-2005|f|most importantly, you have to pray for directions and guidance from the Almighty. But first it's just as important of being the right person as it is meeting and finding the right person.
20-10-2005|m|someone who respect you, someone who will not hout you intentionaly, someone whoyou can laugh with, someone that's there for you during the good and the bad time, someone who is caring,
24-10-2005|f|The right person for me is someone who is God-fearing, completes me perfectly and in whose eyes i see a million possibilities. Once i feel that spark, i'd know i've met him.
24-4-2007|m|which spark madam ? u mean ur xpectation is 4 d guy to b working wit PHCN? omo,spark no b word dem dey joke wit ooo. laughssssssssssss  WISH U LUCK SHA.
24-4-2007|f|if you are a Christian, the Holy Spirit would direct you, if you have a close relationship with God. Also our instincts is another way, there is a difference between feelings, thoughts and instincts,but most people are not aware of these,so they make mistakes about the three. feelings and thoughts might lie,but instincts do not lie. but the mistake we all make is, when we meet someone and its so rosy, we allow our feelings think for us, rather than going by our instincts, our feelings overcloud our thoughts and deceive us.
24-4-2007|f|Alot of people have spoken very intelligently on this issue. And i liketo think that we have lots ofmature minded peopleon this topicin particular.  First of all in finding a rite partner, you have to decide why you wanna get married or what your expectations of a relationship are.  Like its being mentioned earlier, you really need to be whole, complete in yourself before you look for a life partner otherwise your judgements will be blurred.  Definately we need to pray for our Abba Father to guide our thoughts but our Father can only go by whatever we have in our minds thats why its very essentila to be grounded yourself before looking for a mate.  Dont just say the Holy Spirit will do it, God isnt a magician and we have our own parts to plan and we need to shine our eyes.  And dont be fooled by any brother or sister in a church that tells you stuff - shine your eye, and dont be fooled.

07-4-2005|m|Like-minded folks  Hi,  Any "like-minded" folks in the house? I'm a professional web developer with Web4Africa. Please no idle talk.  Holla back.  What do you think about the web community in Nigeria? Has it come of age yet? For me, the answer is NO!  So long ...
08-4-2005|m|My name is Seun and I refer to myself as a professional 'website administrator'.  Of course, the Nigerian web community is not yet mature, but that's good for those of us that have just started working our way up: we have the leeway to make lots of mistakes and learn from them.  When it becomes convenient and safe for Nigerians to buy and sell over the Internet, our web community will start growing much faster!
08-4-2005||well maybe we ain't yet of age. but being the most populous black nation we got alot of Nigerians online. you'll see them chatting, being members of dating sites and perpertuating scam mails. the few cool ones blog like meself blog
02-5-2005||The Web community in Nigeria is pretty much in infancy. Most so-called web designers and developers are a joke.  I believe that we need to invest more time and effort in learning (not necessarily certificates and all that, good as they are).  Most Nigerian-developed websites are dysfunctional and in particular lack content.  No; we have certainly not come of age yet.
02-5-2005|m|AYA, I don't feel inclined to complain about how other websites are a joke. How will we create a presence on the Internet if large companies start investing millions into the training of their web developers?  No, I don't feel inclined to complain. However, if I must contribute all I can say is that the money is not going to the right people. That is all I would say. And there are some good, high profile Nigerian websites out there. MTN Online is good. ShopForLess.com is good, though of Indian roots.
04-5-2005||I am not complaining. This is a discussion on the subject. But then, do we need millions of naira to be injected into training Web developers before we can have functional websites? I don't think so.  It takes more of people being willing to learn. In this case, the so-called web developers themselves. Looks like an extension of the title craze that we are so well known for here in nigeria.  It used to be "Engr", "Architect", "Docteor" and all those. Now the craze is to see every Tom, Dick and harry labelling themselves Web Developers. To complete the joke, most of them add "Professional" before the "Web Developer" part :lol: They only mock the real professionals.
04-5-2005|m|AYA, most of these people can design much better than either of us ...
04-5-2005||Which is part of the problem. There is more to developing a website than the page design, than graphics. Much more.  And I still do not agree about the most you used. I run a web hosting company and have statistics to back up my claims that most self-styled "professional" Web developers are not worth the name, design or anything else wise.  The true professionals are few and far in-between, and they produce excellent work.
11-5-2005||Well, I understand AYA and his quote "There is more to developing a website than the page design, than graphics" is true. What he is trying to say is that more skills are needed in content driving and thats what the web is driving too.  (By the way I would like to greet Seun, the owner and moderator of this site. I have been in contact with him for a while through the net and he has been doing a gooood job with excellent ideas. More grease to your elbows ... )  Seun, sorry I have just registered today. I have been busy and you know that!  I would be here very often, and for sure we'll have more to discuss ...
11-5-2005|m|When I was first 'unleashed' on the Internet, I knew absolutely nothing about what it takes to run a successful website. Two years later, I can say I know a little bit more.  Even if the information is out there on the Internet, it takes time to assimilate this information. It takes time to experiment, make mistakes and finally discover the right way to do things. If I was a web developer working full-time in a big company while trying to learn learning all the practical things I've learnt, millions of naira might have been spent on my salary already.  Summary: It takes time to assimilate knowledge, and time is money.
11-5-2005||Thats true Seun. But if you keep focus time will tell. Seun can you remember or do you have an idea who is using the ID :-naijacoder?
11-5-2005||somehow I might not really get all what you're saying but I agree with you on one point, that:  It sure does take time to get used to the Internet. Most of us started out as chatting freaks, then moved on to getting webpages, and started learning the ropes on the net, to the state we are now. I might not have the IT knowledge of some people but I know a lot about internet culture than most guys out there trying to make money off the net. Thanks to 3 years+ of being a browsing freak.
23-5-2005|m|Would I be wrong to say that most of the really good web developers out there are freelancers? These are people who have worked their way to those positions of authority. I agree with Seun - knowledge especially if it's knowledge you obtain from the Internet or some other unstructured sources takes time to assimilate. I hardly know of a really good Nigerian developer who's not a browsing freak  I'm also a web developer (PHP guru extraordinaire ) - of course I do have works to testify to that and I do have friends too who are professional web developers and I tell you ALL of them learnt through materials they got off the Internet!  The Nigerian web community hasn't come of age but with more and more sites like Nairaland, etc. springing up, we'll get there but we mustn't forget that access has a major role to play in the pursuit of this goal.
27-5-2005||Timba that was a good response and thats the spirit.. If you are availabe and wants to take up projects...... Give it a shout
02-6-2005||Seun, could it be possible to have Nigerians who are resident abroad use this facility as well. I will hold my opinion back on this topic until I get a response. I reside in the UK and my email is mcolanrey@aol.com
04-6-2005|m|Well compare to neighboring African countries and many other distant African countries, we really have come of age !! I mean how many Ghanaian websites or Senegalese websites etc do we have on the net? But when it comes to Nigerians, we indeed have made a record, and the community is growing day by day even as i speak. So i would say in the local aspect yes we have come of age, but in the international scene we do have a long trip ahead of us.
13-6-2005|m|Starcomms have a good website as well. Is shopforless.com indian owned?
21-6-2005|m|Well, no not at all. Nigeria still has a long way to go.  As for sites, most times, when I come across Nigerian sites, I just laugh my ass off and close my browser window. There are only a few that are actually very impressive, but then again some of them tend to make use of "too much" Flash, which I consider to be a resource/bandwidth hog.
22-12-2005|m|##
24-12-2005|m|The fact is that web technology is dynamic. The first web pages we had were just plain hyperlinked HTML texts. Now we have "wise pages"(php, asp, jsp, etc).  Nigeria just caught on and it is difficult to follow when you join in a discussion halfway. All we need are the right clues, the right guidance. If it took you two years to get the knack of intergrating database sites for instance, I believe a forum like this is where you can place guides so upcoming developers do not have to re-invent the wheel.  I suggest we have a reference area where one can go for smart tips. That is how we are going to come of age. Knowledge is meant to be shared. One person can't be the only developer in the country. We have millions of developers in the state and the still make money!Lets be generous. In fact, come to think of it, a lot of us make extensive use of softwares released under GNU General Public License. Let us develop the open source spirit and then we will get there!
24-12-2005|m|##
25-12-2005|m|Open source spirit does not put food on the table. It's not wrong to explore commercial possibilities. Cheap and affordable is often better than free because it puts food on someone's table.
26-12-2005|m|##
05-1-2006|m|I agree with you Seun, cheap and affordable is better. I guess that means open source is at least good Selling the product of your creative effort is just, but even microsoft now realizes its not all money again. The world is going opensource, if microsoft is now sponsoring open source project! Check out www.dotnetnuke.com for details.
09-2-2006|m|the Naija web community will remain at infancy as long as we don't reckon with made in Nigeria websites.We need to support sites like nairaland.com , oneloveng.com to attain their full potentials.

09-2-2006|m|Philip Emeagwali, just because he said so on his website, has absolutely no input to the development of the Internet as we know it today. If we must make a claim, please make sure you have your facts straight. I must tell you, i used to be one of those who look up to him as a role model. But the fact is, no one can subtantiate his claims. Are we so cheap to make false claims? just so that we can be recognized?  Read this mind-blowing article   Untill Emeagwali can prove his claims, i am bill gate and the owner of microsoft corp.
09-2-2006|m|Ynot you have "unmasked the masqurade". Although i don't want to comment on the Emegwalis's claims here but i think i will have to say something.  Philip did next to nothing to warant the claim of making the fastest computer. The smallest computer chip is a result of collaboration of hundreds if not thouusands of inputs from various fields of science and human endeavours.  For someone who write an algorithm to make better use of processing capabilities in all-ready made Cray super-computers to lay claim to making the fastest super-computer is a big lie. For years his claims has not even been substantiated by any visible work.  When he claimed he is the father of the internet were did he put those scientist at MIT, DoD, and the folks that write the specifications for the global internet when he's propably still in Nigeria.  Dr. Emeagwali and Prof. Oyibo are more or less of the same caliber, a scientiest/inventor that can't give the whole world a visible proof is more or less a paper scientist.

15-2-2006|m|lol, hardly do our profs write codes. The best i have seen writes C and VB(and not liike and expert) but is good at producing algorithms.  The thing is that the nigerians abroad aren't promoting the country enough. There are very baddddddddddass developers in nigeria. young and old, but the thing is the country isn't supporting the ITsector like india is doing.  see ehn my brodas and sistas, the thing is that, this IT growth thing is in our individual hands, zinox started itabi,and government now later started backing him. Produce something solid and see if everybody wont say, "He is my brother/father/mother/sister/friend".
16-2-2006|m|What are you saying that Nigerian programmers don't know nothing about inheritance and client-server development. That statement shows that you yourself no nothing.  If you are a developer you don't really need money to come up with a nice software. You will be surprised the day you need a Nigerian developer.

17-4-2005|m|Mamba, when you give a gift to your girlfriend or signficant other, isn't all matters is whether she likes it or not? And if you can get a gift that she likes for 0 naira, isn't that just splendid?  Having said that, Jerry's gift was more of giving her the opportunity to witness the sunrise, and it did not cost him 0 naira. It must have cost him 36 naira if he was on MTn pay-as-you go with per minute billing!
17-4-2005|f|Nature is indeed a gift and I think the advert is so romantic, albeit unrealistic. Watching the sun rise or go down is going a million steps closer to nature. It obviously gives the guy pleasure and him sharing what gives him joy with his girl is the issue. He didn't say for her to reach out and take it now, did he? My point exactly!
17-4-2005|f|I am indifferent to it. Whenever I see it, I just smile and say [I]"MTN and their adverts sef"[/i]
17-4-2005|m|All I can tell you guys is that the above advert is the fakest s**t advert I've ever seen on Nigerian TV. No Nigerian chick is going to ever accept sunshine as a gift and be so happy like that.  All I'm trying to say is that the ad is ... well, WTF.
17-4-2005||@dominobaby I feel the same way.  @mamba ... A correct, intellectual chick will, who appreciates nature and not just money. Well maybe she got to be the emotional kind a little bit. I believe I've met two such chicks in my life.  Now in which comedy again did I hear that you only met three great women in your life? Oh yes, it was in Llyod's video. And Irv Gotti said it.
18-4-2005|m|tji
18-4-2005|f|Are you speaking for the populace of Nigerian girls or the selected few that you happen to know? I wish we'd stop seeing things through jaundiced view.  I categorically put it to you that I would accept that from my man and walk on air all through the day for his thoughtfulness to share something so beautiful and peaceful with me. Don't let the fact that he likened the sun to the shine the babe had brought to his life escape you either. If your babe won't appreciate that, she's simply a different kind of person or you've got real trouble on your arms mate. Relationship is not all about giving and taking of material things, the earlier you made your woman understand that, the better for all parties concerned.
18-4-2005|m|I can't just stop laughing reading you guys contributions to this post. And I am not a bit surprised that it is only Ra, a lady (except Seun who originated the post), that really likes the advert.  I posted intially that I am indifferent to the advert, and I still maintain the same position.  Why? The advert looks un-Nigerian. I want to agree with Mamba and others that no Nigerian girl is ever going to accept sunshine as a gift and be happy about it. We all know why.  I am yet to see any grown-up that really likes the advert. My two nieces likes the advert. Maybe because they are still teenagers. If I am holding the TV remote control, I use to flick to the next station whenever the advert is being displayed. The only good thing I like is the guy's sense of imagination.
21-4-2005|f|Well since this advert is being aired in Nigeria I would say that watching the sun rise in Nigeria is a natural phenomenon that is not surprising. Infact some people don't like to view the sun rise especially on weekends when they are lazying in bed. If you are in a temperate region, you would cherish the sun a lot. It's different strokes for different folks. So do you want the view of a Nigerian living in Nigeria or a Nigerian living outside Nigeria?
21-4-2005|m|Delarontus, diakim says his two nieces like the advert! They are not living outside Nigeria! So I don't think it's right to assume that only those living in temperate regions of the world can appreciate the ad!  However, as the administrator, I maintain that dominant point of view on Nairaland must be that of Nigerians living in Nigeria. That's part of our unique value proposition.
21-4-2005|f|As a boarding house school student in Sagamu, I would go to the school stadium (within the compound and quite nice), sit on the steps and watch the sun sink in the evening. I loved, even then, to see the clouds change colours and remember dragging some of my friends with me. In the mornings as well, before training (I was a member of the school team, yes, football).  I've once again deviated from the root of this debate but I wish to address this issue of 'Nigerians Living In Nigeria' as against those who aren't resident in Nigeria. For screaming out loud, I am no less a Nigerian as you simply because I do not right now reside in Nigeria. I was born there for God's sake; I lived there all my growing up years up until quite recent years. The idea that 'dominant point of view on Nairaland must be that of Nigerians living in Nigeria. That's part of our unique value proposition' is preposterous at best.  If appreciating nature is not your thing, it's got nothing to do with you staying in Nigeria. Believe me, if you moved to Singapore or Dubai, two of the most beautiful countries in the world (in my opinion), you'd still find no time for nature. Please let's wrap this mentality that people who don't live in Lagos, Ibadan (where I did all my growing up, thank you very much) and Abuja.... have some really different mentality and opinions about discussion. While it might be true in some cases, it will be an outrageously fallacious argument to assume that it's true in all.  Mr. Admin....., this is not our first time of bickering over this (sorry to wash our dirty linen outside ) but I'm hoping it's the last unless of cause if I ever completely go out of line and start quoting Tony Blair while you're talking about OBJ.  Capische?
22-4-2005|f|Almost fell off my seat reading you guys' opinion about the "oh Jerry" stuff. I happen to be a [I]Naija[/I] girl, living in [I]Naija[/I] and I absolutely love the advert. Nature itself is beautiful and to be likened to the rising sun is one of the romantic things I can ever think of.  By the way,what do you guys take [I]Naija[/I] babes for? Materialistic or what? Even the most materialistic girl does actually fall in love at one point or the other and such a gift from her lover will definitely have her floating. A friend once told me "a no-good woman was made no-good by a no-good man" So I believe you guys should not be biased with [I]Naija[/I] babes. Or [I]una neva meet babe wey dey interested in you and not the size of your pocket?[/I]
22-4-2005||This is an advert with plenty of imagination. Even the best adverts the world has ever witnessed were not loved by 99.999% of the people but to give those feeble escuses for disliking that advert speaks volumes of our imagination. No disrespect.  Simply compare that advert with others running on Nigerian Tv and maybe you will shift your outlook just a tad bit. not to mention names directly, take a look again at the poor graphics and crazy outlines of the Banking industry's share adverts.  Business wise, the ad is strategic and incites your romantic side to experiment thereby increased call volumes. The advert grabs your attention and appeals to the "other GSM market" meaning apart from business calls, a large amount of fone talk time comes from sweetnothings!! ask any friend that works at MTN. ask yourself, you will be amazed at what people say on phones.  Give a stick to that funny tone at the end of the advert after the MTN logo. It kills the feel good mood the advert created almost instantly. Overall, correct concept and a cool advert.
22-4-2005|f|Thank you jare Femi and Tilly, at least now I know I'm not from Pluto
23-4-2005|m|As an engineer, I see a lot of faults in the advert.  It's technically impossible to have the sun rise at the same angle, with the same intensity at the same bloody time! The two of them have to be in the same building to observe the sunrise simultaneously. So, they don't need a phone at that point in time. Comprehendo? Just watch the advert a little bit closely. At best they will be on the same latitude. But the longitude may vary a bit, maybe by 0.52 degrees.  Hmmm seems nobody understands all this my trigonometry ...
23-4-2005|m|[I]O'boy[/I] I feel you [I]o![/I]  The ad is fake!!  QED
25-4-2005||When did Dayojong do his NSE(Nigeria Society of Engineers) certification that he calls himself an engineer. Mind you a Bsc in actual sense doesnt make you an Engineer. So if you earlier believed yourself to be a master of detail, You goofed there.  Moreover, who says you cannot call a chic in the same building? firstly aren't there high rise apartment buildings where you stay as an instance? cut the lattitude and longitude stuff dude!  Once, I visited a chic in another town. I was talking to her on her mobile phone as if I was right in my own town.Still talking on phone, I entered her room unexpected. you should see the look of amazement on her face and a couple of other chics present. note dayo, your phone works even if you are a few feet apart.  If any chic in the forum thinks that was romantic.and that the ad wasnt bad for both romance and revenue generation for MTN as a consequence,..... pick a phone and call me now... i am a bit available!!
26-4-2005|f|Mamba and Femi i feel u guys! Fake advert. I hated the dance advert but i think its even better than this Jerry one.
26-4-2005|f|I dare say you misread Femi, at least on that last post. Well, I still insist that I like the ad and think it's cool.  I also happen to think it's romantic, but Femi dear, your availability is a bit.....what shall I say?...... unapplicable?
26-4-2005|f|I understand his message and respect your views about the advert. The technical issues he was trying to clarify are not important to me but the fact that he has made a proposal to anyone who thinks its romantic! I dare say you would not, at least not on that statement.
28-4-2005|m|I see that Femi is (still) single. You're still in the ''Love is blind" era and you can afford to waste your hard earned phone credits on on babe in the same building with you. Tell me man, ... will you still do that after you've married for 6 years? Even if MTN is billing 7 naira per minute? Will you? Oh FEEEEMIIIII.
28-4-2005|m|Dayojong,  1) Don't let your fiancee here you saying that after you are married you will stop doing this sort of thing. If she hears you saying such things, she might decide not to marry you!  2) God forbid that any of us should be married for 6 years and not be able to afford a 2 minute call to make the wife happy. God forbid!
28-4-2005|m|Hey...I've been married for 6 years!!!..and luving every bit of it. Just that... I won't fone my wife from within the same building...except it's an emergency...the man needs to account for how the money is spent at the end of the day abi? Seun, do you notice that before we used to call them 'fiancee...' now most guys simply associate them with 'finance'....that's why they think it's ok to call her from the sme room just to say ''good morning''...how far?
28-4-2005|m|This is called 'romance'. Nairaland ladies, please tell him! (I know you want to ...)
28-4-2005||Firstly Ra, I dont understand that bit about availability.....  Secondly Dayo, I am not that single and Even when my Mrs becomes a grandma, I will call her in the same building as I have been doing.  Romance is in the personality and the character. You either have it or don't. But then you can build it. "Oooh Feeemi, I will love to hear that even at the cost of a call"
28-4-2005|f|@ Femi, that was just a silly jibe re your post saying how available you were and stuff.  I must say that your woman is very lucky and blessed to have you. Romance is so essential guys!!! Should I say that again? It's the lubricant in any relationship. I think if guys can only start to treat their women the way they did before they got married, this world would be a better place for all partie concerned.  The saying that 'what it took to get me is what it takes to keep me' should be applied more often. But being the softies the good Lord created us as, we make it far too easy for you guys and go all soft on you and stuff.  In any event, it is good to pamper your woman, it makes your life easier and keeps a radiant smile on her face. May my husband text or even call me from in the same room if he so wishes, to profess his undying love. Amen
29-4-2005|m|Husband: This morning, my gift for you is sunshine...go ahead and grab it...I'm sending it on MTN mms...  Wife: Abeg shut up dere...na sunshine we go chop? Wayo man.  And that, my friends, is a Naija woman. QED. ( Engineer Femi should know the meaning of QED ) . Ra...you were saying...you will accept ONLY sunshine and flowers and kisses...maybe I should take you as a second wife...you can submit your application to...(ooops my babe just caught me typing that ..lol..).  Honestly, it's easier said by the women than done. I have an advice for single men. Anything you won't offer when you're married, don't start it when you're single. You just wait until SHE starts demanding for MTN sunshine...on a rainy day.
30-4-2005|f|, these days i can't help but laugh more each time I watch the ad and remember all your replies.
08-4-2005|m|Hi there,  Do you watch the 'Who Wants to be a Millionaire' programme shown on Nigerian TV stations? Let's discuss this TV programme here!  Seun
12-4-2005|f|Sorry, I don't watch[b]" who wants to be a Millionaire" [/b] TV show but I have a friend who has actually participated. He won 0.15% of a million Naira . He said it was fun but stressful; was at the studio for 8.00am and didn't leave until 3.00pm.
12-4-2005||Well, I do watch the program, and I try not to miss it for any thing in the world. Last week, some cats just messed up. A guy who had 80K decided to guess and went home with 15. Another guy had 250 thousand decided to go on when he wasn't sure and left with only 150 thousand.  Well, it's a very nice show. The presenter is Mr. Cool/Slick. I like that guy.  But, coming to think of it, is a million naira that much (5 million is the show's limit)? Because that is a paltry 7,500 thousand dollars. So in the US, when you hear 1 million dollar shows or lotteries, you know they are talking big time. Because that's 135 million naira! That, my friend, can last you a life time in Nigeria.
15-4-2005|f|I love the program and I look out to watch it. It is actually an interesting program coupled with the way it is anchored. The funny thing there is that when you get the 5th question correct,you get 15k(and they make the questions somewhat easy) , thereafter, for additional questions asked, the amount increases and when you fail any, whether or not you are getting close, your still leave with 15k!  Maybe it all boils down to the fact that it isn't easy to make a million naira so fast!
21-4-2005|f|i want to any just be part of any, modeling
23-4-2005|f|Did not quite get that slimbeauty. I skipped the show yesterday. but all the same, It is such a cerebral show such that the guy on the hot seat needs to know virtually everything under the sun!
23-4-2005|f|That makes two of us dominobaby. slimbeauty seems to be looking for a modelling contract of some sorts. I however regret to annouce that we have no need for models here unless of course they wish to contribute handsomely to our various discussion, in which case we throw all doors open in a warm welcoming gesture.
23-4-2005|m|I must have missed it when I was in Nigeria last time (I usually try and watch local programs for comparison to ours). Our version of the show is not very good but you can win the equivillent of 100 million naira
24-4-2005|m|Hunter: The show started running only this year!  The website of the 'Who Wants to be a Millionaire' show in Nigeria is:   Frank Edoho, pictured below, is the handsome and classy 'host' of the show:
24-4-2005|m|Here is our millionaire.    (personally I hate our version, the original UK version is much much better)  I shall keep my eyes peeled next time I am over for the Nigerian who wants to be a millionaire (The questions they choose for local knoweledge are usually interesting here).
25-4-2005|f|Hunter, as Seun said, the show started this year, and I believe it is going to run for a long while. Anyways, it is aired every friday 8.00p.m on NTA and em... I thought you were in Nigeria at present
25-4-2005|m|Nope, not at the moment (just got back home). I was there for about 3 weeks.
27-4-2005||just thought i'd add that the game show seems to be for lagos people only. not a nice way to treat the rest of the country. the show should be dubbed "Lagos who wants to be a millionaire".
27-4-2005|f|modalov, i think i will oppose what you just said, though, I can't tell for sure where your location is. The show might not be aired in all parts of Nigeria, but I did watch it when I was in Ibadan.
30-4-2005||Now this is my example of the perfect gentleman. Mr Slick, shine shine bobo, correct guy. If I was a chick I would have ...
30-4-2005|f|The guy's a lot more finer, una no make d bobo fine with the open mouth for here!
21-5-2005||i just love these programme.despite the fact that i work in a bank,every friday evening, i rush back home to watch the programme,NEPA or no NEPA.i enjoy watching it.and i think frank is good.he is a fine man and i envy kate a lot for having such a fine man as husband.everything about him is just .....whao,he carries the viewers along.one of this days,i shall find time to be on the programme.i want to say more grease to your elbow, seun,it is wonderful programme.i always get most of the questions right.i will surely come on to the programme one of these days.stay blessed.  jolaoso
21-5-2005||seun ,do you actually give out the money(cheques)i mean is it real?  i have to find out.  thanks.  jolaoso
23-5-2005|m|As long as the questions are intelligent, I will watch it when I get back to Naija!
23-5-2005|m|The programme is fantastic.  The moderator is looking cute with good spoken English. He creates tension and panic in the participants, puts everyone in suspense. I love the guy. Splendid performance!
24-5-2005|f|The programme is really good programme - a very educative, entertaining and stess easing one.  I never wish to miss it. The presenter is very good. Infact, he is the best presenter and very,very,very lively.
24-5-2005|m|I know they are multiple choice questions, but what are the examples of questions asked in this Nigerian version of Who Wants to be a Millionaire?
01-6-2005|f|It is a programme I'd really love to be a part of, only that you could not tell if it's reality show because I got a lot of friends that got the scratch card and hence they were not picked. If anybody knows how to register for 'Flying High' plese let me know.
01-6-2005|f|There was a guy that was asked a question about family tree and i think he went for a very dumb answer and he went out with nothing. my bro said it was fear that gripped him so hard.
01-6-2005|f|this guy is definitely the bomb.. i just sit in front of the T.v & trip for his looks, good spoken English & knowledge.. the show is my best show so far in naija T.V..... the auditorium being used is so tech.. i first thot it wasnt a naija idea but thanks be to God .. we re moving higher in Nigeria....no be so? pls jolaoso u said he's married to a kate? which kate o?  thumbs up for the show anyway..  the funniest thing is that.. wen we all sit in our numerous homes watching the contestants, we feel we know all the answers.. but i bet ur arse that if u happen to be on the show.. u will be tensed & u will be no different fro those who make it up to 150K & still make funny decisions that bring them back to 12K
01-6-2005|f|Kate Edoho of AM Express.
13-6-2005|m|Hi guys, I can really see that this Nigerian version of who want to be a millionaire is a must watch from the you talk of it. The version we have here in UK its interesting and real, not a bad idea to copy a good thing since we equally emulate the ugly ones too. I think its time for Nigerians to benefit from the firms that has made a lot from them.  Also, it will be lovely if National lottery be introduced into the country and give our people the chance of being millionaires.  I'll definitely look out for these programme when I be in Nigeria later this year (hope it will still be on)
14-6-2005|f|O!my God.....!So Kate of a.m express is the wife....,good for her.Haba these girls sef, where dem dey catch dem,even Mariam and Charles Anazodo...hmn...hmn...hmn...!.I watched the program a few times when I was at home and I think it is really nice,but the version here in the U.K. is a bit difficult,maybe not for those who are natives here though. but considering if you have to win 1million.....what kinds of questions should one expect they ask....?!Your guess is as good as mine.
14-6-2005|f|pls i wanna get the KATE starit o! am always at work very early so i dont get to watch AM express anymore........ is kate the busty fine girl on AM express
20-6-2005|f|1 million naira is much in Nigeria o...considering the standard of living. But, come to think of it, even 7500USD is not "paltry" to an average American too!
20-6-2005|f|Kate is the lady with the low haircut. I don't know about busty!
20-6-2005|f|delarontus, thanks, now I know who Kate is. She's not the one I thought.
11-4-2005|m|Talking about books reminds me of some Nigerian or other African authors that have written very rich novels, which have even enjoy international recognitions. Those days when I had time to read novels, the African Writers Series and Fontana Novels are my favourites.  Who can forget "Things Fall Apart" by our own Chinua Achebe? If you have read other books and yet to read any of Achebe's book, then you have not read any book. What about "The Man Died" by Wole Soyinka? It is a must read by everybody. Who have read "Cried The Beloved Country", by Alan Paton? Then you must know what I am talking about.  Anybody who has read books by African authors in this forum? Then lets share, our culture is very rich.
11-4-2005|f|Oh Bless! Diakim, you just touched a soft nerve. Even though Things Fall Apart, The Arrow of God and some other Chinua Achebe's books constituted my English literature textbooks while still in College, I took out time to read them years later. They are indeed wonderful works of art.  The Gods Are Not To Blame, Our Husband Has Gone Mad Again, Lion of The Jewel... again the list is really endless. Wole Soyinka's books are not books you flip through and fully understand what he is talking about. They need thourough perusal. Even now, I read his books at least twice before the full meaning sinks. Have you read any of Peter Enahoro's books? They are simply hilarious.  I always get excited when talking about books, I better stop now or go on and on.......
11-4-2005|m|I am yet to read any of Enaharo's books.  Talking about understanding Wole Soyinka's books, and the needs to read it again, you are very correct. I cannot but marvel at his command of the English Language and at how he manipulates words. "The Trials of Brother Jero", and "The Interpreter" are just books you need to read and read again.  Books like "Weep Not Child" and "A Grain of Wheat" by Ngugi Wa Ti O Go (former James Ngugi, I hope got the spellings right), just opened our eyes to the struggles for independent by the Easter African countries.
11-4-2005|f|Reading this post has opened my eyes to a new dimension entirely. I visit the bookstores or internet looking strictly for books by my favorite authors such as J. Archer, Sidney Sheldon, J. Grisham, Robert L. and the rest of them, whereas there are loads of African writers whose books have far deeper meaning and depth than these authors. I am by no means belittling the work of Western authors, I couldn't if I tried, but the fact remains that we are rich in culture and blessed in language. As Africans, we best express ourselves in our diverse languages, now imagine that wealth of expression being married with verse knowledge of English language and put down as a book. As from tomorrow (well, at least for the next couple of months) as time permits, my next purchase of books will definitely be from the African shelves. Trust me, I'll pass on the authors, titles and what the books are about.
11-4-2005|m|That is good. And this is what I will do too as soon as I have the time.  While at it, you might check out "The Radiance of The King" by Camara Laye, Author of the African Child. It was a book I read long time ago about a white man that was attracted to the splendour and wealth of an African king, and he went in search of the monarch...  You can also check out "Toads for Supper", another Fontana Series (I think the Author is Chukwuemeka Ike, I can't be too sure now). This one is unputdownable. I trust you will pass on the details of the books purchased as promised.

11-4-2005|f|@diakim,  I've ordered Toads for Supper on the internet already and should get it in a couple of days. I instantly fell in love with the title. That is precisely the kind of rich expression I was talking about. Speaking of which, who has read Wole Soyinka's The Deceptive Silence of Stolen Voices? Imagine, isn't the title alone captivating? Deceptive silence, suggesting that the voices are indeed not silent yet they are stolen. How intriguing! Suffice to say that 'AKE's' true meaning elude me till date. Better luck when next I read it.
12-4-2005|m|Wole Soyinka books are in a different world from our own. I am still surprise that the guy is a Nigerian. Though I have not read the book "Deceptive Silence...", but from the title I know it is going to be another treat.  Good for you to have ordered the book "Toads for Supper". There are many invaluable lessons to be learnt from it.
12-4-2005|f|hey guys i really love this idea of discussing book because I LOVE TO READ. OH MY GOSH I REALLY REALL DO!!! but one thing is tht ithe only book by an african author i have read is things fall apart. i am more into sidney sheldon, J grisham (hi fi girl!!) etc authors. (hey Ra there was a movie on J grisham's book, "runaway jury" have u seen tht? i mean. i have read many books by many author i usually am not selective about the author. but i will tell u guys tht sidney sheldon really rocks!!! i mean he is such a good author and if you guys get the chance you should really read the books!! okies mabe the guys would not really like the books because they are more of the romantic love stories. but they are all worth it .  Ra i love one of grisham's novel i do not recall the title but it was tht first one tht i read tht drew me to his book. it was about a man who gave up his practice at a profitable firm to help out the homeless people. this was after a homless mother and children he met died in the cold due to asphixiation... do u remember the title?  ok guys i would like to get into african authors so could u all please recommend good novels to me?
12-4-2005|m|If you are really interested in reading books by African Authors then I will suggest a few:  - Toads for Supper (by Chukwuemeka Ike?), a Fontana Series - No Longer At Ease (by Chinua Achebe), African Writers Series - One Man One Wife & One Man One Matchet (by Chinua Acehebe?), African Writers Series - The Concubine (by Elechi Amadi), African Writers Series - Efuru (by Flora Nwapa), African Writers Series  I guarantee you will enjoy reading any of this books. I am sure Ra will have one or two to recommend to you also.  African books are very rich, instructional and educational.
25-4-2005|f|I really must commend African(Nigerian) authors, they take us back to our roots. Apart from the first one (Toads for supper)I have read all the other books enumerated by diakim, very interesting piece of writing. I wonder if anyone have read "The Palmwine Drinkard" by Amos Tutuola. That novel had lots of grammatical errors, it was a transcription in pidgin English prose of an oral tale of his own intervention. Our people back home didn't really appreciate the novel because of the writer's imperfect use of English language but the writer gained world fame with the novel. Talk about a prophet not being recognised in his own land.
25-4-2005|m|I have heard about the book "The Palmwine Drinkard", and also the author, but I have not been opportuned to read the book. I still hope to read it, somedays.  Talk about a prophet not being recognised in his own land,our own Chinua Achebe, even though is on wheel chair is a lecturer in an American university, teaching African Literature.
28-5-2005|m|when u get to read "mine boy" by peter abrahams. you will get to understand the art of african litrature. nothing feels more thrilling than to be on a pure african concept, with great facts emerging from an insight of realities.

20-7-2005|f|The only book i am proud to have read is, Things fall apart and god's are not to be blame. I didn't just read them as high school books. I read them on my own and loved them
20-7-2005|f|hot angel,  Nice read those. If you can lay your hands on Arrow of God by the same author, go for it. It's a very nice one as should be expected of Chinua Achebe
20-7-2005|f|Okay Ra.

18-11-2005|m|I look around for one of my best African Writer of all time..Peter Abraham, author of "The Mine Boy". I read that when I was in primary 4, and It affects my outlook till today, It remains a joy for me, anytime.  There are several authors like Cyprian Ekwensi and his "Burning Grass" and "Mallam Elias Passport".  Wish we could celebrate all these works of professionalism.  There is another one, "A Collection of 12 Plays"..but I don't know the author.  Enough on board...  Maybe later
21-11-2005|f|Hello, Like everyone here, I too am a bibliopath, I cannot live without books and it is very true how rich our culture is. There are up and coming authors that I'm sure you'll enjoy. The celebrated purple hibiscus by chimamanda Ngozi Adichie is one Icarus Girl by Helen Oyeyemi Shakara Dance-hall Queen by Tess Osonye Onwueme(actually made into a series on BBC) What mama said and Tell it to women, also by her are very good and of course, Windsong by our dearly loved May Ellen Ezekiel. There are so many books. It really makes my heart sing when I see people enriching themselves with positive material.
22-11-2005|f|''The Potters Wheel'' by Chukwuemeka Ike is my all time favourite. Very interesting. I hardly ever read african novels (except am compelled to) but after reading it (actually picked it cos i had read all da sidney sheldons, jackie collins, harlequins, blah, blah, blah dat i had in da house) i searched my pops collection for all da african novels he had. .
25-11-2005|m|It is truly marvellous to have stumbled on a site where I can chat to other nigerian bibliophiles!!  For the past few years I've been especially addicted to African authors and African themed books. I have so many favourites and am actually in the process of setting up a book club with the above as the main books to be read.  I'd like to contribute which books I've been reading over the past few years (don't panic...not that many!!)  The Poisonwood Bible ( Barbara Kingsolver)  A Cowrie of Hope - Binwell Sinyangwe  Zenzele - Nozipo Maraire  So Long a letter - Mariama Ba  Nervous Conditions - Tsitsi Damgbaremgba  The Concubine - Elechi Amachi  Everything Good will come - Sefi Atta  Changes - Ama Ata Aidoo  Purple Hibiscus - Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie  Alan Paton - Cry the Beloved Country (MUST READ)  James Ngugi - Weep Not Child, A Grain of Wheat  Wole Soyinka - Ake (MUST READ) particularly if from Abeokuta as I am!!  Chinua Achebe - Everyhing He's ever written  The Devil that Danced on the Water - Aminatta Forna  I could go on but I'll stop there for now!! I'll be visiting this post often now that I've discovered it so please let me know if you've read any of the above and if you haven't I strongly suggest you do. Also, does anyone know where I can get pacesetters novels to buy in the UK?? Thanks a lot!!
28-11-2005|m|I hope you've not all forget "Kongi's Harvest" by Wole Soyinka, it's epitomises everything happening in Nigeria.  I have read like over and over, in fact, it's like a bible now.  One interesting English book is the "Chauser's Tale". I so much loved the book, I read it while waiting to resume University in 196, and I was shocked when I found out it's a text for Part 2 English students.you can imagine the thrill when discussing it with them as if I am a lecturer  Book reading keeps me sane, at least for a while...
19-1-2006|f|i think am movin into d african world again norrmally i read black american authors books . but now am goin african i can remeber readin some books 4 literature when i was in high skool dat was how i got intrested in readin so yall send me d titles

11-4-2005|f|Please, why does my PC keep asking me to get Windows Update because the PC is vulnerable to security attacks from the Internet?  I get the updates everyday and it keeps telling me to update! It's frustrating! Is it the presence of worms, virus or some other threats? I also need to know the best anti-virus to download.
11-4-2005||Because Windows have been updated many times recently. What you need to do is to keep current with tech news so as an Internet user from your own house you'll know the right steps to be taking. Check out:  for more info.
11-4-2005|m|Delarontus,  You probably never wait for the Microsoft Windows Update process to be completed. Microsoft Windows Update needs to download some files from the Internet [I]and then install[/I] them!  What to do: [list] [li]Visit  in Internet Explorer, and wait for it to load. It takes a while.[/li] [li]Click on 'Express Install (Recommended)'. You'll see "Windows Update is looking for available updates..."[/li] [li]Wait until you see the list of packeages that need to be updated.[/li] [li]Now Click 'Install' to download and install the updates. This will take some time![/li] [li]Reboot the computer if instructed and repeat this process until you see 'No updates available'[/li] [/list]  If there are any error messages, please record them [I]word for word[/I] and post them here.  Hope it works for you!
11-4-2005|m|Delarontus,  If you follow the process detailed above by Seun, and you are still experiencing the same problem, let us know. What operating system are you using?
13-4-2005|f|U guys thanx for the replies. I actually tried downloading the updates but some are unsuccessful and are always unsuccesful, don't know why. I'm using Windows XP, service pack 1, Home Edition 2002. I guess i'll continue to get the 'install updates' until i'm able to succeed.
13-4-2005|m|This is the problem I always have with people when I try to help them fix PC problems from a remote location. They refuse to copy down error messages even when specifically asked to do so:  People have taken out of their time to help you and you cannot take the time to write down the error messages. So I'm not happy with you at all.

13-4-2005|m|"These updates were unsuccessfully installed" In other words, success! Congratulations!  Common problems: a) Your connection to the Internet was interrupted while the updates were being downloaded. b) You are trying to install Windows XP Service Pack 2 update but your PC doesn't have a valid license key. c) Other.  Except for case (a), there must have been some other error message. If (a) is the case, just keep trying or manually download the updates. It takes time for these heavy files to be downloaded!
14-4-2005|f|I already did that yesterday and no longer get the security message. Thanks
16-4-2005|m|Delarontus,  I am sure you have a worm on that machine. I'll recommend using McAfee,.If you have all these Ad-Ware or some other funny programs, remove them.  Most of them only opens up ports and holes in your machine for hackers, which might account for the constant request for upgrade.  Again, check from which source the Notice for Upgrade is coming from?Is it from Micrsoft or when you enter some particular websites?  Do a thorough Virus Scan.
10-5-2005|m|Hi, If your PC keep on telling you to update,try and uninstall any anti-virus on it and reinstall current one i.e the current version like Norton Anti-virus 2004 or 2005,Macaffe 2005 anti-virus. Don't try to download any anti-virus because they can only give you free trial that may lapse say within 30 days which is not adviceable. And it can even cause some virus to enter your system through the Internet. So, with this piece of advise and others you have been receiving,i hope the problem is solved. Thanks, Yours, Francis.
26-5-2005|m|Found this thread and found it interesting, but what I want to ask is, with all the bugs continually been found, and with all the patches been developed for the Windows XP platform, are these incessant updates necessary?  What I'd suggest is very relatively simple. Turn off Automatic Updates. If you need help on how to do this, I'd tell you how to. I really do not think that all of the constant updates are worth it.
26-5-2005|m|Thats a really bad idea Farriel, if you leave your computer insecure you open your self up to a whole wave of identity fraud, hacking, slowed down use etc.  If you really are that worried about it run Linux.
26-5-2005|m|Yeah,  I know it sounds a little weird, but there are far better secure measures to take than download updates incessantly.
30-5-2005|m|Mightbe you might think of trying the alternative OS? I run Mepis linux and cant remember ever bothering about updates, or worms or virii. I open any mail without thinking of attachment problems. And Linux has gotten to the point of being as easy to use as windows.  If u need any further info, I'd be willing to help.
07-6-2005|m|That is the best solution.  I have turned mine off, I will only update my machine when any a new SP is out and when that SP has been around for awhile and it is proved stable.  At the moment I am on SP1 and have no problems, I use McAfee in conjunction with Microsoft AntiSpyware which is free to download if you have a genuine XP copy and not an illegal copy.
07-6-2005|m|Not keeping up to date with security updates while you are using windows is a walk in the dark especially if you are connected to the internet directly. If you are using a router with NAT then you should be safe as long as u dont open any malicious emails.
07-6-2005|m|Jogego, what I find is that some of thier updates are not well thought through and cause more havoc than good.  I tend to rely on a good firewall and a good antispyware and also regular backups.
07-6-2005|m|To support your opinion, can you share your first hand experiences of Windows Updates 'causing havoc' on a system?
07-6-2005|m|My experience was with SP2, I was running XP with SP1 with no problems and then SP2 came out and I updated, boy was that a mistake! I had continual errors and my system kept hanging!  I thought it must be due to a virus and did a full system reinstall, which was fine until I added SP2! and then problems again.  Now I have kept with SP1 and not added SP2 and have no problems whatsoever.  I have turned of the windows update service as well.  I do have the Windows Beta Antispyware as I rate it.
09-6-2005|m|XP2 is very buggy that is a known and documented fact. In fact windows itself is too bloated I guess thats why it cannot be properly secured. To be honest, I never install any updates and just tend to ignore them. I am behind a router and hardware firewall and for all intents and purposes I should be fine.
09-6-2005|m|I install all the updates and I've never had any problems. Some people using pirated software have probs installing XP2. Some software products are also known to conflict with XP2. I have never had problems with any of the updates and I install them as soon as they become available. I think that is the best course of action for the average person.  It would be very wrong to encourage people not to download security updates.
09-6-2005|m|First off, I am not encouraging anybody not to update. Secondly, I put it explicitly that am behind a HARDWARE FIREWALL which is why I cannot be bothered with the stress. The fact that I love walking on the edge does not mean you'all should follow me does it?  And the issues with win XP sp2 are well documented, it ranges from hardware to software and not only for people using pirated copies of windows.
09-6-2005|m|It would be very wrong not to tell people of my experiences with it.  By giving all views people can judge for themselves. Some people may find it ok, some may have the problems I had.  The fact that it worked for you is by no means an indication that it is perfect. I work in a testing environment and you soon realise that what works fine for A may not for B due to different environments and variables.  I also did say that I will wait till they have another stable SP and may try it, but as I am not having any problems now I would like to keep it that way.
09-6-2005|m|jogego: what about browser exploits? Does your hardware firewall protect you from browser exploits?  Vieira: Two questions, - Out of every 1000 installations of SP2 in your testing environment, how many were problematic? - Out of every 1000 unpatched Windows PCs owned by ordinary folks, how many will be compromised?  You wll find that one number is much larger than the other.
09-6-2005|m|Broser exploits? Matey, are you still using IE? I havent used IE for going on close to 4 or 5 years now. Opera, Mozilla and lately Firefox are much better security wise. And seems you still are going on about statistics. I definitely know you dont follow tech news closely. If you did, the problesm caused by SP2 were well documented in most IT magazines, PCW, Pcmag, PCWorld all had stories on it. Some went as far a recommending people not to use it.
09-6-2005|m|Actually when I was talking about testing enviroment I was referring to Lotus Notes. But my company as a whole does not upgrade whenever Windows release a new version.  They stick with proven stable platforms before deciding to move to the next version.  We are actually in the main workplace still running Windows 2000 and only deal with XP on clients locations.  So we very rarely get problems as it is a proven enviroment for our cocktail of applications.  SP2 has a bad rep in my circles but we all use other security software for virus, spyware and firewall protection.  At home I operate XP but use Firefox as my browser and I also have a firewall and antispyware (microsofts actually).
11-6-2005|m|bad news on the mozilla suite front with the return of the frame injection attack :/
11-6-2005|m|bad news on the mozilla suite front with the return of the frame injection attack :/  agreed, but am sure you know the attacks on the mozilla suite is less compared to the attacks on IE. The fact that majority of the web browsing public use IE makes IE more attractive to hackers.
11-6-2005|m|I don't play with updates; it's the least one could do to at least maintain some amount of security. Windows updates, Firefox updates, virus definition files, etc.  Even if you use Firefox on your PC, other people using the same PC might decide to use Internet Explorer at one time or the other. Besides, very few cyber-cafe or company PC administrators would be bold enough to install firefox on the PCs they manage and remove IE! What do you tell people when they notice that some of their websites "aren't working" anymore?
11-6-2005|m|Am not sure you can really uninstall IE. Its been so tightly interwoven into windows that all u can do is pretty much hide it from view. Its good to keep your computer up to date. Since I adminsiter my own computers, I can be pretty sure that nobody can cause any wahala on my network. The general use laptop has simply mepis on it. Linux by design does not allow u to install or do any administrative stuff so its pretty secure. But then, I up date my system files every two weeks.
15-6-2005|m|Important: Windows Security Updates for June 2005!
11-4-2005|f|Every where in the world, it is becoming increasingly clear that schools are no longer what they used to be and consequently pupils/students are a far cry from what they used to be.  In yester years, when schools were indeed institute of learning, parents were always happy to send their errant or somewhat naughty children to boarding schools so as to teach them some well tailored manners. Schools were not just places you went to master your tenses or add up correctly. No. You also learnt to be cultured and well behaved. Teachers were respected and feared more than parents. To some extent, it would seem that parents gladly shelved the responsibility of scolding and training their kids to schools and teachers not to talk of seniors. But if this method produced the desired results was it so wrong? It would also appear that teachers then were just too happy to take on the extra responsibility of instilling discipline in their students.  These days, some schools gain the cool logo because teachers are not allowed to discipline students. Students roam the street when they should be in school. There is absolutely no respect lost for their teachers. I am concentrating more on the public rather than private schools. I am well aware that some private schools manage to instil discipline and a lot of finesse into their students while some merely succeed in turning them into spoilt brats.  Unfortunately for the society that produces these uncultured students, their negative impacts are felt at the universities, in the work force and all the way to the top. Sometime recently in one of the Western countries, the lawmakers actually sat down to pass a bill forbidding parents from smacking their own children. What is the world coming to? Is it part of civilisation to spear the rod and spoil the child? If parents pass on the responsibility to teachers and teachers are hand tied not to punish or God forbid, beat erring students, what hope is there for us as a society and a race at large?  Now, the question is, do you subscribe to the Western views that children should not be punished in school? Do you honestly think that the students coming out of colleges everyday are fully baked and well armed to go into the Universities without succumbing to peer pressure to join cuts and such like?  Finally, what seems to be the way forward, the family or the institutions of learning?
11-4-2005|m|Ra,  If the schools of yesterdays were so good at instilling discipline into the hearts and minds of young people, then why is our country so corrupt? Why have these 'disciplined' children turned out to be corrupt adults?  Is it possible that boarding school, by presenting students with a lot of unreasonable rules, only succeed in teaching young people how to be 'smart' and get around the rules?
12-4-2005||Yeah yeah yeah, "schools and children of nowadays are bla bla bla, in the days past bla bla bla." As far as I know this is just a normal statement parents and adults always make that in their days things were much better than now. Your grandparents did the same, your parents too, you too now, and your children will. Are we then saying that the world is getting worse with each generation? If that's the case, I suppose we would have all perished!
12-4-2005|m|The problems we are facing nowadays with schools and children is that the parents have abadoned their God-given responsibility to discipline their children to the school. The bible says "Spare the rod and spoil the child". No wonder we continue to have secret cults in our higher institutions of learnings. This is because most of the students did not receive the required home trainings.  In this our jet age, parents hardly have the time to be interested in what their kids are doing. All they do is think about how to make more money. A child that is left to himself/herself will definetly get spoilt. You cannot use money or gifts to substitute good moral and religious trainings for your children as some parents do.  There is nothing that can substitute godly training for children, and this has to be started at their early and formative age, and to be done by the parents. If the parents are hypocritical, the schildren will see into them and end up adopting their negative habits.  To answer, your question Ra, I don't subscribe to this so called western civilisation of not punishing children in schools. Let children be disciplined in schools, as in the olden days. But let their be a committee set up by the PTA to address any child abuse or act of wickedness that might be perpetrated by any teacher against any of the children.
12-4-2005|m|If the schools of yesteryears were so wonderful and good at instilling discipline into the current generation of adults, then why is our country so corrupt? How come the "undisciplined" white boys and girls are able to run their countries better than we can in Africa in general? How come you don't have interracial killings breaking out from time to time in the US, for example.
12-4-2005|m|Seun, the answer to the question you just raised is very complex. The african nation is cursed. That is why we continue to have bad leadership, and ethnic and religious crisis. That is why we are bedevilled by so much problems.  This situation is clearly beyond the issue of discipling children at homes or in schools. The western world or the whites have their own maladies too, but the african case is beyond normal.
12-4-2005|m|Interesting opinions so far, I don't even know where to start or what to even say. Maybe start on the issue on being cursed backwards, step by step. Is the African Continent cursed, or specifically Nigeria? Cursed by who? maybe the person that raised the issue on my motherland being cursed should tell me the answer because I am really anxious.  What makes you and I today in terms of character and definition of what is good and evil is the difference in training, experience together with the environmental factors around us while we were being brought up by our lovely parents. I personally didn't grow up under those stringent conditions that I totally classify "Child Abuse" and that does not make me a spoilt kid, or uncultured or unmannered whatever implies. But then again when you talk about sparing the rod, it does not mean beating up a kid for nothing ? thinking you are training him or her. it doesn't work. we just end up creating a sense of hatred and pain in the children.  They end up growing up in need for revenge to the pain they underwent during their development. Infact Seun's question, gives us a lot to think about. The truth is we believe so much in our orthodox system and its really ruining us, and would continue to ruin us if we continue to implement them.  Things like corruption for example? how does it develop. I think its from "greed" and where does "greed" comes from ? well we really need to address the problem right from the source to the origin. Referring to spiritual aspect is just uncalled for . Lets be real.
13-4-2005|m|The discussion about whether or not Africa is cursed is continued at: Is Africa cursed (spiritually)?
13-4-2005|f|Interesting turn and twist to this thread really, although I must say we seem to have missed the point here. Seun, if the leaders who are admittedly products of the yester years more than anyone else are this greedy and void of any sense of remorse, what this present generation is capable of is indeed unthinkable, trust me.  Good point as it is, it veers away from the crux of the matter. Let us shift our focus from the minority in power and re-focus on the larger population; our own parents, uncles, aunts and cousins. Even to people who are light years older. The quality of education (chukka blocked as it is now) is a far cry from what it was. There exists no discipline on whatever level, parents expect teachers to tutor their children both academically and morally while teachers are far too busy cutting corners in endless attempts to make ends properly meet to care about what students are getting up to. I simply wanted to know if I'm too harsh in my assertion that parents ought to take more notice of who with and where their children 'hang out ', what comes out of their mouth, how they respect other people and expect it in return. Our schools on the other hand should be made aware of how low they've dropped in their duties to educate students and guide them in the right path.  I said it earlier but it is so important that it bears repetition, should this present generation by any chance gain access into power, it might not be long before there exists a huge vacuum where before there existed a great nation known as Nigeria.
14-4-2005|m|Should parents know what their children are up to? Yes!  Should parents be harsh, authoritative 'disciplinarians'? No!  Should parents spend more time with their children? Yes, yes, yes!  Should parents spend all the time criticizing and punishing their children and regularly deny them the freedoms and pleasures of childhood in an effort to make them turn out right? No, no, no!  I am more concerned that parents today (maybe Lagos parents!) are so out of touch with their children that even when they decide to spend time with their children the children are not happy. Parents cannot make up for time spent away from children by being extra strict (i.e. harsh) when they are around. it does not work that way.
14-4-2005|f|And the schools, institutions of lower and higher earning, what duty of care, if any, do they owe their students?
14-4-2005|m|The responsibility of any business is to meet and try to exceed the expectations of its customers. So the responsibility of a school is simply: to meet and try to exceed the parents' expectations - or return their money!  Now the issue of what parents can rightfully delegate to a third party is more complex ...
17-4-2005|f|If that suggestion was to be taken up, I'm afraid many schools will have to turn their classrooms into other business ventures as they are bound to refund parents. I am of the strong opinion that the schools are not doing half as much as they ought to be doing with and for students these days. I repeat that I am not talking about priviledged schools where parents pay through their noses and had better get more than their expectations, but more about public schools. Nigeria is bound to run into even deeper waters if nothing is done about the quality (I cringe to use that word) of students being produced and graduated from secondary schools as well as higer institutions.
17-4-2005|m|I think public schools are a joke., and it's not only in Nigeria. You get what you pay for. These days even 'market women' send their children to private schools.  The problem is that, as a parent, there is nothing you can do to hold officials of the school accountable. If you withdraw your child in protest, the space simply goes to the next available child. they lose nothing. Ra, I'm afraid that there is nothing that can be done to solve the problem.  Perhaps the public schools should be sold off one at a time to enterprising businessmen. Government should then sponsor research into ways to reduce the cost of running schools in Nigeria, so that they will be able to charge lower school fees.  If Goverment doesn't do it, enterprising young men or corporate bodies eventually will.
17-4-2005|f|Schools are not what they were. In the past, people learned just for the satisfaction that they were knowledgable. But now education is the way to ensure that at least you have got a good future. (not guaranted though). And exams I think are a waste of time.  We should be allowed to do more practical work than just merely studing from books. That is really boring! I think we all will learn more if we apply what we learned to professional world. I mean most of what we learned in school we hardly apply them when we start working ...
03-5-2005||
03-5-2005|m|I believe you should discipline your kids, why? because its character-forming. If you grew up in a family where you were caned for errors or bad behaviour it would become clear to you after some time that its for your own good and after some time it becomes second nature. The inherent politeness or discipline in african kids is because parents take time to discipline their kids.  Agreed parents have not wised up to the fact that they need to be closer to their kids as this would reduce uneccessary punishment. This is because fathers still see themselves as breadwinners and taskmasters/disciplinarians and not as nurturers.  in schools, i believe corporal punishement should be made an article of law but a punishment journal might be instituted in schools for logging punishments and the degree of and reason for the punishment. this would reduce victimisation due to the fact that teachers know there is a written record (this might be kept by specially appointed class monitors). It would reduce the hedonism and unruly behaviour that is sweeping the nation.
03-5-2005|m|My personal opinion is that corporal punishment is a very primitive way to discipline a child. It is effective on the short term, which makes the parent blind to the need to use methods of discipline that work on the long term.  Many people think they are teching their children to be upright, but all they are teaching their children is that might is right. "I have the power, so if you do something I don't like I will inflict pain on you". Might is right, so if I make a mistake nothing happens, but if you make the same mistake and I catch you, you are in deep trouble. Might is right, and that is why when there is any problem our youths pick up cutlasses and start making bonfires and cutting heads. Because might is right.  Are you saying that Charles Taylor wasn't beaten as a little kid? What about Sanni Abacha? The soldiers working with him? Were the perpetrators of our civil war not beaten as children? What about those who are corrupt among our politicians?  Africans are fond of defending elements of their culture that clearly aren't working for them. With all the child-abuse that takes place in this country, we are more corrupt than "morally bankrupt" countries like the United State with their "evil" gay rights "heinous crimes" against unborn children.  Sorry, beating is not the way to train a child. It is a way to harden a child. We have a lot of hardened people in this country, and I am tired of it. I want us to have more people with tender, gentle hearts.
13-6-2005|m|Huh? Maybe you forgot about ethnic cleansing in serbia and former yugoslavia. Not to mention the current issues going on in the eurasian countries that resemble african problems
13-6-2005|m|Corporal punishment is legal in many states in the USA. You paint too saintly a picture of the states. The southern states condone corporal punishment, yet they are the strongest and richest country on earth
17-6-2005|m|Firstly, I don't subscribe to the story about Nigeria or Africa being cursed. It's all boulderdash . We just didn't develop as quickly as Europe and the US in the areas that matter today(namely Science and Technology). We are a confused people, since the days of slave trade, and we need more than a GREAT LEADER to lead us out of the wilderness. We need to WANT to leave the wilderness. Secondly, our "Institutions of Learning" are nothing more than "Institutions of Getting Certificates". More teachers are unconcerned about developing the "Leaders of tommorrow", and concerned about extra-curricular salary generating ventures. Thirdly, Africans as a whole will find it really hard to escape the above two positions, 'because we don't actually have the inner undefinable quality in Europeans, called PATRIOTISM. We had no choice over the creation of our countries, and as such, we don't really really see why the country's interests supercedes our personal interests.  Or so I think ....
13-8-2010|f|All about education is now something else,especially in this our country Nigeria.We are just managing and asking GOD to come to our aid.
12-9-2012|m|Would you still support corporal punishment?
12-4-2005|f|I don't really fancy Nigerian comedies, the actors and actresses try their best to make us laugh but I am usually not amused. As a matter of fact, papa Ajasco and company only makes me mad, 'Fuji House of comotion', yeah they try!. But I remember very well, in the olden days there was 'Sura the tailor' 'Ojo ladipo theatre group', 'Jaguar' 'Oga Bello,papiluwe and co' 'second chance'. Those were rib breaking comedies. I don't know what is happening now, are people no longer creative?  American Comedies, I definitely enjoy anytime, comedies like 'Friends', 'Dharma and Greg,' 'Martins',' Malcom in the middle', 'Living Single', I could go on and on and on.
14-4-2005|m|'Fuji House of Commotion' is definitely the best Nigerian comedy! It's the only Nigerian comedy I will actually sit down to watch. I think the fact that there are so many people on the cast contributes to the comic effect.  Trish, it is possible that those "comedies of days gone by" are not as funny as you remember them to be.
14-4-2005|m|Fuji House of Commotion is definitely a good comedy. I make sure I watch every Sunday evening if I am at home.  There was one comedy that wasn't funny at all. Thanks God they have stopped it. That is 'Laugh Pattern'. Those guys acting it were anything but funny.  I am yet to find any comedy program that I can rate as really good. Maybe with a little more creativity, their performance will improve.
14-4-2005|f|Some Nigerian comedies are really hilarious and have me in stitches most times. Others are simply appalling. Actors and actresses trying too hard and ending up looking silly. Fuji House of Commotion is really nice and I watch it any time I can. Home videos are also really nice. I'm amazed time and again at how fast we've advanced in the movie industry. People like Baba Suwe, Osofia, Dejo, Elesho and another albino guy with loads of freckles (I don't know his name) are so terribly funny.  Just like Seun said, if one was to get films or plays by Papiluwe, Jacob (bless his soul), Aluwe and the rest of them, what seemed funny in their days is almost annoying now. It's like watching Efe with Baba Ijesha in it again now, it's really silly.  In any event, I love Nigerian comedies and I think those guys I mentioned above are exceptionally funny and what makes it better is the fact that they are so natural.
15-4-2005|f|Fuji House of Commoton is one sure comedy. The other comedians we have prefer to act movies or stand-up comedy than to do short plays. Baba Suwe is my favourite anyday. Look out for Madam Princess, she is very good.
15-4-2005|m|If comedians like Baba Suwe, Lati, Osofia, Ajirebi, 'the albino guy with freckles' () all team together, I believe they will produce a very good and hilarious comedy.  These guys are naturally funny. Much unlike the others who are trying to be gentlemen and at the same time funny. Comedy does't work that way. These is no class in comedy.
09-5-2005|f|When it comes to Nigerian comedies I think 'Fuji House of Commotion' is the bomb, and I try as much as possible to watch it every Sunday. 'Papa Ajasco' is ok too, and there is this new one they call 'Face to Face'. It's ok too.  ''Dharma and Greg' is cool. [I]ed: an american comedy[/I]
25-7-2005|f|What we have are bunch of clowns and not comedians.They make fool of themselves and espect you to laugh at their funny ways .Even though we get few of them who are real comedians who make good comedy.Ihate BabaSuwe,he made me sick
27-7-2005|f|Hey, Nigerian Movies that r suppose to be funny aint funny at all.i find them annoying.They all try to be funny. Can you compare western movies(comedy) with ours we r way back But all the same more effort
27-7-2005|m|I find the modern version of Papa Ajasco very boring. But let's give credit to whom credit's due, when I watched Osuofia in London I cried with laughter for the first time in a really long time. That dude is funny, which is the reason I am not going to watch part 2.
28-7-2005|f|osuofia in london part 1 is very boring and annoying. but part2 is alright. i find Nkem Owoh irritating and not funny
28-7-2005|f|Latoya.. u don't know funny. Osoufia in london cracked my ass up. I remeber farting while watching. haha.  Anyways some nigerian stuffs r funny. baba suwe is, that afin guy is. and uhmm some people r .
28-7-2005|f|Hey Hot Angel,if u think u know what funny is then tell me miss. what u consider funny isnt what i consider funny ok?we r different. I repeat OSUOFIA IN LONDON is not funny to me.
28-7-2005|f|Slow down ma....we r just ordinary people. I am sorry if i got the "YOU" in "you" outta "YOU".
29-8-2005|m|I like Nigerian comedies its gr8!!!!
29-8-2005|f|some comedies are funny but most of the ones that are meant to be funny aint
30-8-2005|m|@nike4luv u are right!
30-8-2005|f|oh, i didnt kno i was does any1 watch papa ajasco..its shyt but my sis likes it, its meant to make pple crack up but nuh uh
30-8-2005|f|I don't like Baba Suwe and his wife, Moladun Kenkelewu. The albino guy, Afin Elesho is the one that cracks me up...and he doesn't have to paint his face with charcoal and look ridiculous to make me laugh.
30-8-2005|f|babsuwe is still alright and afin..  at least won mo ibi ti ebu ti ma ba eyan
31-8-2005|m|yes baba suwe is good and papa ajsco too.
17-9-2005|m|gr8 to baba suwe and also baba Latin i give gbosa to both of them........
26-9-2005|m|Who is Baba lantin.......................... I dun know him.
18-10-2005|m|well comedies are there to make u laugh and i believe nigerians are trying well there are some comedies that arent funny at all. but they are really puting in their best
02-11-2005|m|Hmm ... even after several months, 'Fuji House of Commotion' remains the one and only worthy Nigerian comedy. or is there any new contender for the crown?
09-1-2006|m|And also Papa Ajasco[b][/b]
09-1-2006|f|I remember basi and company in the 80's written by the late ken saro wiwa (i think a lot of folks here wont remember this). but that was a very good commedy show.  now papa ajasco isn't funny at all to me, i'd say rather silly. fuji house of commotion still remains the only commedy show thats good and worthy of my time!
17-4-2006|m|@bagoma Paja Ajasco is funny and not silly, but i agree with you that Fuji house is more funny than Papa Ajasco,
17-4-2006|f|i don't bother watchin nigerian comedies cuz instead of makin me laugh,they just end up annoyin me but the guys on nights of a thousand laughs r good.i'll watch that any day any time.
17-4-2006|m|Bagoma, I remember Basi & Co.  The one thing I find really satisfying about Nigerian comedians is that fact that they are mostly original. None of the fake yankee accents that some of the so-called Nigeria Hip-Hop stars (and some movies stars) so poorly carry with them. Just makes me cringe.  I find the few comedy shows that I have seen so refreshing and as good as anything out there.
18-4-2006|f|ikebe super featuring dawda, pepeye and the rest of them  Boy! then my elder brother will beat the hell out of me if he sees that magazine with me
19-4-2006|f|Oh My! So is Fuji House of Commotion still on ? ! Geez!! I miss it! IT's so hilarious! And P. A( Papa Ajasco) of course!
12-4-2005||Hi,  I just got the megasim that allows one to use 2 sim in one handset  However I have discovered that when I choose the option of 'Both line Online' the phone restarts everytime it wants to switch from one network to another. In addition on switching to the second network, it will ask whether it 'should copy sim contacts in the phone' and give the Option of 'Yes or No'. When you choose no it will still duplicate some of the contacts in the phone book.  However, using the same megasim in Samsung R220, it will only indicate that it is searching for network when switching from one network to another without restarting the phone.  Can anyone help me with codes or information on how to disable the autocopy function in the Sagem myv-55. I am attached to the Sagem myv-55 because I cannot use the Samsung R220 to browse on Glo Internet like I do with Sagem  Thank you  Adecrown
12-4-2005|f|How much did you get the megasimm, and can it work with sagem myx-5m?
12-4-2005||Angelgirl,  The megasim is sold for N3000 in Abuja and these are the benefits:  1. You are able to carry 2 Sim in 1 - the 2 Sims are combined into 1 megasim 2. You have 2 categories of uses namely: a) Stay on one network or the other - manually select the network you want to be on at anytime b) Set it to Auto - This means the megasim will be alternating between the 2 lines as set by you either as slow (3minutes interval), Normal (2 minutes interval), Express (1 minute interval)  My observation with megasim is that it requires searching for Network when the switch is made and for Sagem with Browser like Sagem v-55, it usually require you to decide whether you want it to back-up you Sim contacts from the Phone. This requires you to select yes or no but this does not apply to Samsung where the only thing that makes you know that Network switch has taken place is a beep.  I believe megasim will work with your Sagem myX5m but the issue of the phone rebooting everytime there is a switch between networks is what I don't know about your model.  Apart from the issue of crossing from one network to another automatically that Sagem My-v55 seems to have problem with because it is manufactured for Vodafone UK, there is no other problem.  The megasim gives you the benefit of having your 2 lines with you in the same handset.  Finally, when using the auto mode, the megasim will keep the phone tuned to the only network available where only one network is available I.e no switching until another network is detected.  Thanks.  Adecrown
12-4-2005|f|Hey Guys! Am a new wap user with Glo, maybe the more experienced users could share their experience here, for example, wap and mms configuration problems, GPRS availability, Glo current wap and mms promotions, freebies, downloads and stuffs.
12-4-2005|f|Glo is currently running free MMS promotions till September 31.  My New Discoveries:  1. I can send and recieve free mms, from my phone, or my online glomms album as far as my credit is not 0, and I my validity is still on.  2. The MMS can be a wallpaper, ringtone or picture.  I earlier had problems with sending MMS, until I checked the MMS server, via message options, found out it was configured with default settings that came with the phone, changed it to Glo settings, and immediately I was able to send.
15-4-2005|f|I visited this site on glowap today, with address  (no www on wap), I was able to get to this thread and read clearly all the posts, but there was no option to reply or login, i think Admin has some job to to do in that area, Seun i commend you though for being able move mobile nigeria forum, at least it can now be viewed on wap, who knows maybe in future, we might have contributions fron wap surfers abroad, well done.
15-4-2005|f|Kudos seun! This post was made from my phone, login and reply enabled with  .
16-4-2005|m|Cool! I guess I'll try this too.  I guess Nairaland will promote Globacom in a way. I won't be surprised if they add it to their WAP homepage very soon.  Good job Seun, so you're the 'big kahuna' of this site. Cool!
17-4-2005||Glo GPRS has been down at my residence for about 2 weeks now. I am very tired of calling them to complain.  Looks like it does not matter whether I call or not, so I will 'siddon look'. :-(
19-4-2005|f|I hadly experience unavailability of GPRS, except a few times at home (Festac) when Glo network is down,  @AYA, Is GPRS always available where there is network?
19-4-2005|m|I think the answer is 'No'. I miss AYA a lot.
19-4-2005||No; GPRS is not always available where there is network coverage. For example, the last 2 weeks GPRS has been off at my end, I have been making and receiving calls and doing SMS as always without any problems.  If there is no network there can be no GPRS. But the network may be available and GPRS be down. This is because GPRS is a "layer" running over the regular GSM network.
19-4-2005|m|I'm learning this for the first time, AYA. So how come GPRS data transfer is faster than GSM? How can a layer running over GSM have more capabilities and, in particular, speed?
20-4-2005|m|I guess I have to answer myself!  From the Wikipedia: "Packet-switched data under GPRS is achieved by allocating unused cell bandwidth to transmit data. As dedicated voice (or data) channels are setup by phones, the bandwidth available for packet switched data shrinks. A consequence of this is that packet switched data has a poor bit rate in busy cells. The theoretical limit for packet switched data is approx. 170 kbit/s. A realistic bit rate is 30-70 kbit/s.  And for more about 'EDGE' that AYA has been talking about on Mobile Nigeria: "A change to the radio part of GPRS called EDGE allows higher bit rates of between 20 and 200 kbit/s. The maximum data rates are achieved only by allocation of more than one time slot in the TDMA frame. Also, the higher the data rate, the lower the error correction capability. Generally, the connection speed drops logarithmically with distance from the base station. This is not an issue in heavily populated areas with high cell density, but may become an issue in sparsely populated/rural areas."  So GPRS is not actually faster than GSM. But it uses the available bandwidth more efficiently by dividing data into 'packets' and using all the bandwidth available to it as a given time.  B-)
20-4-2005|f|Well done Seun! From a lay mans point of view, am i right if i conlude from the statement above that GPRS does not run on 'real time' like the internet and this is the reason why charges are calculated by amount of data sent and recieved?
20-4-2005|m|Actually, the Internet does not run on real-time either! It also also uses packets. That is why sometimes it's difficult to get decent Voice over IP performance on the Internet.  A GSM phone (or wired telephone) has to allocate a dedicated data channel for each call. Or else the voice quality would be as poor as VoIP on our crowded VSAT networks!
21-4-2005||Seun has given a good overview of GPRS and EDGE.  I will add that edge requires a hardware upgrade of the regular GSM infrastructure. EDGE is actually GPRS running over a more advanced network. That is why EDGE is also referred to as EGPRS (Enhanced GPRS).  Did I pass?
02-5-2005|m|From Infotech Gurus like you guys, I think you passed, but I have never experienced GPRS faliure in my end (V/I & Ikoyi). Its beautiful using it here because you ask for the network and it anwers you immidiately, thanks to Glo.
14-5-2005|m|you guys are moving some high tech stuff here, i conclude that infotech is harder than medicine!
23-5-2005|f|Can someone please tell me was happening to GPRS with Glo since i recharged today, i have not seen a single flash of the service, i thought the GPRS problem is over.
23-5-2005|m|Angel I think it would depend on what area you are at at the moment, and as far as i now the GPRS problem is over
23-5-2005|f|Am in Victoria Island.
23-5-2005|m|Then you should have no problem, what handset are you using and are the setttings on your handset correct? If they are correct then you have no issue but if they have been tampered with then............ anyways write your phone model type and ill give you a new pair of settings to put in it
23-5-2005|f|Thanks legry, GPRS came back after i switched my phone off and on twice.
14-6-2005|m|Plz i'v been tryin to connect my glo for gprs, i got all settin, i hv sent alot of sms to glo recommended line but till date am still not connect. I wish to knw if the gprs connection is location dependat ofcoz a friend stayin with me is able to use he's for browsin but mine is not goin thro. My set is segam myX-7.  plz i need any glo staff to help me out.
14-6-2005|f|Debugger, you have to call Glo Customer Care Line (121). Tell them you have completed you configurations and you need them to provision your SIM for WAP and MMS. You will recieve password for your Glo online MMS album as soon as they provision you, or better still take you phone to any Gloworld center near you.
14-6-2005|m|Angelgirl: i see u hv alot to say. i was in globacom office today. the guy who's name is John Ayim (johnny) did wht he can and ask me to load my account which i hv done and wait for an sms from glo.  but who know hw many decade for the sms to come.  am hopeful anyway. chau
14-6-2005|f|i advice you to be patient, i was once desperate to get mms and wap on my glo line too, so desperate that the day the notification came i didnt know, so since you have been to their office, in the next 2 days if you dont recieve password for your online glo mms album, call 121, but if you do, then switch off you phone and on again, you will start browsing wap immediately.
19-6-2005|m|Angelgirl, it has been more than 2days, infact this is makin it a week plus now, am desperate so patient does not count for me now. if u knw anytin u can do plz do for me, my glo number is 0805 261 1597, if u can ask they to provision this line for mms and wap i will be grateful.
10-8-2005|f|Hi guys, i want to see if this will work, connect to nairaland with glo wap and see if you can download this ringtone. Nigeria Jagajaga
10-8-2005|m|Hmm ... this won't work unless we have a dedicated section for ringtones. Nairaland WAP doesn't yet have support for downloading of attachments. For the Nigeria Jaga Jaga Ringtone, try this link:  [center]i.nairaland.com/img/nigeria-jaga-jaga.mid[/center]
11-8-2005|f|Thanks a lot Seun, it worked!
11-8-2005|f|How do i send the tone to my phone?
14-8-2005|m|Type i.nairaland.com/img/nigeria-jaga-jaga.mid into your phone (instead of, say, wap.nairaland.com)
14-8-2005|f|<snip>It's only singing the song. How do I set it to my ringer?
13-4-2005|m|(was Re: Institutions of Learning)  22 And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the unclothedness of his father, and told his two brethren without. 23 And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the unclothedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's unclothedness. 24 And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done unto him. 25 And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren. 26 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant. 27 God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant. Genesis 9:22-27  And also 6 And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan. Genesis 10:6  Kazey: If you read further from there, you will discover that the African continent descended from Ham, the father of Canaan. This is the premise I based my statement that the African continent is cursed. The two other sons of Noah constitutes the present European nations, and you can see the difference yourself.
13-4-2005|m|So well I don't see any link here, and besides ? so since we are cursed? as you said we are. then nothing can be done. Lets just sit down and watch our generation perish and destroy each other. I cant really believe that some people actually believe in such things. well I rest my case. no futher comments.
13-4-2005|m|Diakim,  If one reads that passage carefully, it appears that not all of Ham's descendants were cursed. Only the Canaanites, who were the subject of a prolonged campaign ('ethnic cleansing' in today's terms) by Joshua and the Isrealites ...  Anyway, my point is that even if Africa is actually cursed, it is not written in that particular passage of the bible. Besides, there have been times in history when certain African nations were world powers, so we can't attribute our current problems to a curse.
13-4-2005|m|Ham commited the offence. Canaan was cursed. Canaan represents the seeds or descendants of Ham, which includes Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan.  Phut (Put) is the old name for Libya, a member of the set african nation which has an association with Canaan, descendants of Ham.
14-4-2005|m|Diakim, why do you feel that Canaan represents Cush, Mizraim and Phut in addition to himself?
05-7-2005|f|I don't think Africa is cursed. We're developing, that's just it. IIt's a slow process and can take several generations.  Africa in the past (hundreds of years ago) used to be the most prosperous continent and most civillized, then we fell (through war and other gabage I think). We'll rise again, but it'll take time.
08-7-2005|m|Africa is not cured neither Spiritually nor Morally. If you love to read like me, you would easily observe the methodology the Europeans used in order to sink that statement into our subcontious mind to justify the need for slaves. Remember that slavery was started by the missionaries before the capitalists took advantage. Really it is a long story ...but believe very deep down in your mind that it is not true.  We were all created in the image of God, and who can curse who the Lord has blessed. How would God allow a drunk to curse his elect, remember drunkiness is a sin before God, and we know that the eye of the Lord is too pure to behold sin, thus in his drunken state do you think God who have allowed or given attention to the curse?
04-10-2005||i don't believe in that spiritual thing. all i think is just that africa is not as wise as the europeans or americans. everything depends on our mentality. we are too attached to our traditions (i suggest we should start to eliminate some because they are our "enemy of progress").
04-10-2005|f|As a citizen of the most powerful country in the world i know our prosper has come from the hardwork of slaves and subjugation of millions around the world who work for pennies so my country can make trillions. Africa has been raped of its valuable resources by the Global North for hundreds of years. The plight of Africa can be directly linked to the affects of globalization.
05-4-2006|m|good talk Michelin!! the truth is that we are too superstitious and we attribute every single negativity in our lives to witch doctors and charms, i know some people here in Spain that any time they loose a job, they try to blame one uncle in Nigeria for that, i mean this is bullshit, our mentality is still so low, and until we wise up we are not going no where and one more thing we need in Africa to go ahead is called TOLERANCE, we lack this 9 lettered word in Africa
05-4-2006||i've often heard this Africa was cursed by Noah theory. So i had to go and really read tha passage to see if Noah's curse had a direct effect on Africa. And i found out it did. Africans are descended from the son that Noah cursed. I believe strongly but not totally that it has had an effect on us.  if you look at it, biblical statements about certain groups of people always come to pass. God's statement to hagar, the mother of ishmael, who was the son of Abraham goes. From him shall come princes, and his sword shall be against every man and evry mans sword against him. Ishmael is the father of the Arabs, who are muslims.  If you look at world events you will see that Arabs have the most oil rich princes and truly just as God put it , arab world is fighting everything from palestinian homeland dispute, to terrorism, to hijacking of planes. to sucide bombing. To killing of Christians . The truth is their sword is ever ready.  Therefore if such a bibilical statement came tru about arabs, i think africans have felt the same effect. we really have been servants of servants over the years. e.g slave trade, racism,poverty, faminine etc . But that doesn't mean we aren't great people and we can't rise if we come together.
05-4-2006|f|Perhaps there's something we might have missed along the way.  (1) The whole world was cursed - (Gen. 3:17) Right after Adam sinned, God said, "cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life." I think when you read it in clear context, the ground that was cursed includes everywhere on the face of the earth.  (2) The earth was partially redeemed - (Gen. 8:21) When Noah offered burnt offerings after the flood, God said, "I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake." To me this sounds like a partial redemption (or 'reversal of the curse'?) of the earth - 'partial' because the earth is still undergoing the effects of the Fall today (Rom. 8:19-22). So then, the curse of Gen. 3:17 is reversed in Gen. 8:21.  (3) Everyone can be blessed - Gen. 22:18 A few generations after Noah, God promised to bless everyone in Abraham (Gen. 18:18) and in his seed (Gen. 22:18) - "And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice." The seed is said to be Christ (Gal. 3:16). What this means is that the supposed curse of Africans does not hold today - Africans can be blessed in Abraham's seed.  The idea of Africa being cursed spiritually does not hold much weight even from the Bible itself, if one reads Gen. 17:8 where God promised to give the land of Canaan to Abraham - I wonder if anyone would suppose that God was promising a cursed land to him? No, because Canaan was described later as a land flowing with milk and honey (Exo. 3:8 and compare with Lev. 14:34).  Nations have been prosperous or poor in the history of civilization and politics, and God has not restricted prosperity or poverty to any nation today based on a text in Genesis. Africa does not remain under a spiritual curse made to Ham and his descendants - that curse is no longer in force today.
05-4-2006||The thing I always find funny about Africans is our short sightedness. We always forget that in the past, our nations were great and prosperous. I mean Mali is argualbly the site where the first university in the world was built. Timbuktu had millions of volumes of books and scholars from all over the world used to come and study in Mali. But we never remember those stuff. All we can remember is colonialism until now. I think it is a bad case of inferiority complex. Even if we were cursed God is a forgiving God and if we are repentant there is no reason why he will not forgive us. If we are cursed then I wonder what type of predicament the Natives in North America are in. Theirs must be a double curse because the things they suffer are even worse than us.  Point.
05-4-2006||@ mlks_baby, Thank you for that post
05-4-2006|f|Welcome anytime, enjoyed your post as well.
05-4-2006||how come our fathers were selling thier brothers to the white man for mirrors? From the bible it shows clearly that Noah cursed the descendants of ham , which is africa.  i'm not saying thats why we are underdeveloped. But we have to ask ourselves why are we the way we are. Don't say colonialism, because we were living in bushes before then.
05-4-2006|m|nightrider, you have been indoctrinated. There were many large African civilisations prior to colonialism and very few Africans were living in bushes. You're falling for the same arguments that were used to as a justification for the subjugation and enslavement of Africa/Africans
05-4-2006||i'm not falling for anything, and i'm not pro slavery. God forbid.  But i do know that we were grossly underdeveloped. while europe was building ships and railwaylines, we were going nuts over simple things like mirrors. that shows we knew nuthin about the industrial revolution going on in those days.  when the british came To Molest the bini kingdom. the binis lost the war becuz they said they hadn't seen sticks that brought out fire before(guns). We hadn't developed at all. Thats why we could sell precious human lives for silly mundane household equipments.
05-4-2006|m|This is misinformation. Ham, Noah and his curse had nothing to do with Africa. This is a hebraic 'tale by moonlight' taken over by the Christians and was later used to justify African slavery.  As for slavery you should that originally the Oba of Benin like many other kings in Africa refused to sell slaves but then they were deposed to punished them and stooges installed. step up your history study.
05-4-2006||The Oba of bini kingdom was not deposed becuz he refused to sell slaves. he was deposed for killing british soldiers who wanted to enter the kingdom during a seasonal festival, which forbade strangers. The oba after the British government retaliated was banished to the ancient city of calabar where he died. The british then went ahead to steal all the art work in the kingdom. E.g the very popular Okada head. step up your history study
05-4-2006|m|You're talking of the much recent British deposition of Oba Ovonramwen in 1897. By this time if you'll note slave trade was already abolished. I was talking about the Portuguese and the Dutch earlier foray into Benin Kindom way back in the 15th century when slave trade was still just starting.
05-4-2006|f|i heard da same thing toooo!!!!!!!! that we were cursed by God because of that story  i don't believe it thou!!!!!! but whatever it is, thank God all is beta now, at least than at first, the times of our forefathers  come to think of it, i think it's due to our own lack of sense and mentality
05-4-2006|m|
05-4-2006|m|if all this bullshit about Africa being cursed by Noah is true and that God is punishing us because of that curse then i will serve that God no more, what have i done wrong to merit that curse as an African? but i don't believe it. WE NEED TO WISE UP , educate ourselves because were alone in this world and we must stop frightening our lives with bullshit, people can not swim in beaches because of silly stories of mermaids and so on, infact Africa needs another 100 years to cope with level of today
05-4-2006||at this time we were also building pyramids establishing the great universities and libraries of Timbuktu and Cairo perfecting the art of ivory, bronze, and teracotta sculptures domesticating the coffee plant Shaka Zulu was building an army of thousands of people and inventing military strategies Great Zimbabwe was thriving The gold trade was in full form Decendants of Black African Moors were ruling spain, ( they ruled for 700 years) The city of Aksum ( where the Ark of the covenant resides) was thriving we were practising mathematics (   and much more  So just because we were not planning the Atlantic slave trade or planning how to go into North America to kill entire tribes of Native peoples or planning how to colonise entire continents does not mean we were backwards.  Every civilisation has their time. Currently it is time for the west and soon our time will come again.
05-4-2006|m|
06-4-2006|m|well i dont really know what to believe but if we look at it, we'll see that the european countries are far developed than we are but i also believe every curse can be broken so nairalanders in Nigeria and other African countries BEGIN TO PRAY. Send missiles to destroy Noah's curse else we might be backward for a long time ANYWAY CURSE OR NO CURSE I'M GONNA BE WHAT I WANNA BE NO MATTER WHAT THE CASE MAY BE
06-4-2006|m|i dont think africa is just one big empty piece of land, i think it has alot to offer to this world but isnt used correctly we dont have natural disasters and alot of things
06-4-2006||I never said that Africa was backward becuz of Noahs curse. But Noah did curse his son, by telling him, his generations will be servants of servants. And unfortunately we are the sons generations.  But every curse has been broken by the blood of Jesus. The bible says cursed is he who hangs on a tree. And all so he was wounded for our transgressions, and the punishment for our peace was upon him and by his stripes we are healed.  So Africa is not suffering under a curse. But The generations of ham were cursed and the generations of ham is Africa( that cannot be denied)  maybe i'm undererstimating the overall development of Africa b4 the europeans came. But i do not believe that we were technologically advanced. Except someone can prove me wrong.
06-4-2006||First, I am not sure about what your definition of "technologically advanced"is.  I think you are underestimating the overall development of Africa before colonialism. I used to as well until I started doing some research into Africa before colonialism. The other thing you have to note is that even in Europe and Asia there are ethnic groups or nations that have advanced at a faster rate than others even in pre-colonialism times and post-colonialism times. Also take note of some of the feats that "ancient" people achieved that even in this day and age and with our "technological advancement" scientists can't figure out how they did it. For example The Pyramids, The Gambia stones  However before colonialism Africa was progressing at her own rate. We may not have invented gun powder and guns however we were inventing technology that worked for us at that time. I guess most people ask the question of what led some cultures to invent things like guns, gun powder, e.t.c. Many people have tried to answer this question by giving theories like it was the difference in weather, geography e.t.c. YOu can try reading this book Guns, germs, and steel : the fates of human societies by Jared Diamond.  The other issue is that before slavery and colonialism Africans were considered to be equals with europeans. The Bini people sent Ambassadors to portugal and the Oba of Bini( I can't remember which one) was speaking and writing portugese before colonialism. Historians have said that even up until a few years after colonialism there still existed a group of Bini people who could speak a pidgin of portugese. Once again if you read some of the history you will see that the earliest portugese people in the Bini KIngdom wrote that they were very impressed with the organisation of the Bini kingdom. And it even goes as far as the art work that europeans were creating then. In some of the art work black people were represented in clothes talking to Europe's Kings and Queens. The representation and feelings about African people changed from positive to negative when Europe wanted to Colonise Africa. They started writing stuff about us being babarians, uncouth, backwards e.t.c. so that they could justify their colonialism. The history people know about AFrica is the one that has been written by the European world to justify their treatment of Africans during colonialism and slavery.  However you asked about Africa and technological advancement , I will post some links in my next post
06-4-2006||This following was copied from this site   In Ivan Van Sertima's (1984) book Blacks in Science: Ancient and Modern, countless examples of African science from articles by several different authors are given. A few examples are listed below:  1. The Dogon of Mali had an excellent understanding of the solar system and the universe 700 years ago. The Dogon had detailed knowledge of a white dwarf companion star to Sirius A which was not visible to the Unclad eye. Western scientists stated that there was no way that the Dogon could have uncovered this knowledge on their own and that it must have been supplied to them by a visiting European or an extra- terrestrial visitor.  2. The Yoruba tribe had an exceedingly complex number system based on twenty.  3. A 35,000 year old, fossilized baboon bone found in Zaire, the Ishango bone, is covered with a series of notches or tally marks, which makes it the oldest mathematical object in the world, and the world's earliest number system. The bone is also a lunar phase counter, which suggest that African women were the first mathematicians since keeping track of menstrual cycles requires a lunar calendar.  4. There was a very accurate calendar system in Eastern Africa by the first millenium B.C. (Lynch & Robbins 1984).  5. A megalithic site similar to stonehenge dating to 300 B.C. was found in northwest Kenya. Its nineteen basalt pillars were aligned extremely accurately with the stars and constellations (Lynch & Robbins 1984).  6. A model of a glider dated to the 4th or 3rd century B.C. was found in Egypt. The structure of the object was most definitely aerodynamically designed (Messiha et al. 1984).  7. An iron-ore mine in Swaziland, the oldest found in the world, was dated as 43,000 years old. The ore specularite was used as a cosmetic and pigment (Zaslavsky 1984).  8. Africans developed technology to build sea-worthy boats and the ability to navigate over long expanses of ocean . There is ample evidence to suggest that African explorers reached South and Central America long before Columbus made his journeys (Malloy 1984).  9. 1500 to 2000 years ago near Lake Victoria, carbon steel was made in blast furnaces. The temperature achieved in the furnaces, 1,800C, was much higher than was managed in Europe until modern times (Van Sertima 1984).  10. By the year 1000 AD, in the Middle East, Ibn al-Haytham, a Muslim mathematician and astronomer, was studying atmospheric refraction, and by the 1100s a fellow Muslim, geographer Abu Abdallah Muhammad al-Idrisi, divided the world into seven climatic zones. Climate changes have long since tuned vast savannas and grasslands bodering Africas Sahara into desert. Translations of Arabic texts into Latin help spread knowledge of such instruments as the astrolabe.  Ancient African Numerals  Mathematics in Africa started much earlier from the first written numerals of ancient Egypt around 3100 BC. Ancient African calendars made use of numbers and calculation at an early stage. Ancient Africans also discovered and use the concept of zero (see The Discovery of Zero), and wrote several texts on math and other subjects.  some more info  chemistry has its roots, in Ancient Egypt. They used it in the creation of synthetic pigments for clothes.  In the Nok culture Iron working, smelting and fabrication of iron tools became widespread in the region from around 350 BCE 
06-4-2006||Thanks, very enlightening. I'd really like to read your links. Because i look around at my office and i can't see one thing we invented. from the computers to the fans , to the T.V, even the carpet, bottles for drinking water. evry thing is either imported or a product of technology transferand even then its just assembled here . we've got to wake up .
13-4-2005|f|A discussion at work today prompted this topic. There was an argument on how the kind of music you listen to and how your first 5 best artist (musical of course) immediately says what kind of person you are and shines a bright torch on your personality for all to see. Well, I was one of the active or should I say vocal members of the party that strongly stood for the argument. Just as the way you drive and your writing have been found to bespeak volumes about who you are deep within (another discussion for another day, really) music, your choice of it, to a very large extent, also tells a lot about you than what you say.  For someone like me, if I were to reel off the names of my top 5 musical artists, they would be:  1. Phil Collins (Another Day In Paradise, All Of My Life, I've Been Saying Sorry) 2. Michael Bolton (Said I Loved You, Soul Provider) 3. Bryan Adams (Everything I Do) 4 Tunde Baiyewu (Lighthouse Family; High, Lifted, Ocean Drive, Passing The Hours) 5. Sade Adu (Smooth Operator, Your Love Is King)  Those are just the first five and I guess they and their songs say a whole lot about the sort of person I am, well, to a large extent as I said.To some it will obviously show that I am far from my teenage years, to others it might appear boring and then again to some it depicts rich and soulful music. Deduce of that what you may .  I love Lagbaja with a burning passion and have every single one of his work from the days of Colours. Speaking of Tunde Baiyewu, does anyone know that he's gone solo, no more Paul Tucker and that he's recently, well last year really, released his first album? Check it out and listen to some of the songs on his site ww.tunde.co.uk. Tracy Chapman (Last night I heard a screaming, She's Got A Ticket)has my undivided vote any day, any time.  I guess it's time to move over and let you guys have your say as well. Feel free to agree or disagree as you see fit, but the fact is, I strongly believe that one's choice of music says a lot about their personality.
13-4-2005||for me I listen to Hip Hop mainly. you know Rap and R&B. I also love me some rock, a little jazz, a little afro beat,a little clasical. infact I listen to all kinds/types of music, as far as it sounds nice to my ears. but Hip hop is still my first love. I can't really say I have a favourite artist, or best five. because there are a million and one artist out there and you like different things about each one and gain different ideas from each (if u're also into music).
15-4-2005|m|I used to love classical music; used to play 'Beethoven's Fur Elise' over and over on my PC!  Now I prefer songs like 'I will Always Love You' by Whitney Houston, which can only be rendered by performers with a lot of vocal 'range'! Songs like Marvin Gaye's 'I Heard it through the Grapevine' which appear to be meaningful (even though they're really meaningless!)  When I was young, I used to listen to kids songs like "It doesn't matter what you look like ... the outside is what others see, but the best place to look is right inside!" (Colby's Missing Memory) and songs from Kids Sing Praise videos. Maybe that's why I'm such a softie today, if Ra's theory is correct ...
15-4-2005|f|@Seun, please don't tell me you outgrew Bethoven....... I completely adore classical music and yes, it does say a lot about who you are, if you ask me. Pieces like 'Hallelujah Chorus' Handel - Messiah.... well, it all brings memories rushing back from the days I used to be a chorister. It's one of my dreams to attend an Opera where these songs will be rendered live one of these days.  Erm... that part about you beign a softy......... we can't very well tell, can we?
15-4-2005|m|I am a Jazz lover. Jazz makes me happy and cool. My favourite seven artists are: Yanni, Dave Koz, Kenny G, Najee, Spyrogyra, Earl Klugh and Grover Washington.  Of course I like other type of music also, so far the ryhthm is nice and it is not noisy.  I developed interests in Jazz music as a result of dissatisfaction with the rubbish some people churned out in the name of music.
17-4-2005|m|Jazz and classical music is just too weak for my listening pleasure, I live for HIP HOP, RAP and HARDCORE  I only switch to R&B when chicks start to complain......
17-4-2005||@Mamba, now that's my man . some peeps are just afraid or ashamed to say they like Hip hop. as if it's some strictly childish thing. anyway here is one of my best music quotes ever!  "Rock music can change things. I know that it changes our lives" says Bono. "Rock is really about the transcendent feeling. Theres life in the form. I still think that rock music is the only music that can still get you to that eternal place where you want to start a revolution, call your mother, change your job or change your mind. I think thats what rock music can do".  BONO in "Time magazine" Dec 17th, 2001
17-4-2005|m|@Trae, is rock the same thing as hip-hop?  Well, whatever, I do not like hip-hop. The only rapper I would voluntarily listen to is Eminem (though I liked the 'Fresh Prince of Bel Air' much better) And I don't like 95% of rock music either; the only rock musician I've ever enjoyed listening to is the young Avril Lavigne.
17-4-2005||@seun. no it's not. I just like the quote. and somehow it's true. hip hop-/rap can really influence you, but somehow rock does it a much more instantaenously powerful way. I can remember many a times at home when I uped my CD volume and repeatedly played some rock songs like  U2's "beautiful day" AeroSmith's "I Dont Want To Miss A Thing" Bowling for soup's "girl all the bad guys want"...just to name a few.  it was like I was in a whole different world/realm. it felt like heaven.  ...the fresh prince now goes by the rap name : Will Smith/Big Will
01-5-2005|m|Hey Mamba and Trae I am feeling you guyz, cos i like Hip hop to the core, it makes me feel like the hulk, I like hardcore cos, it's raw. and my best rappers are Ludacris ( He is d bomb), 50 Cent (cos his muscle can make a niggah to hurstle), Eminem, Xzibit, Snoop Dogg, Ruggedman, Mode9, JayZ, Ice Cube etc. I flow hip hop, cos it turns me on, and listen to R&B when my Chick is around, i actually had a group in Naija then, and we went for so many shows, both within and outside the campus. Trae Keep it up, cos hardcore is d best. Cheers
01-5-2005|f|@traez, u should try nickleback, linkin park and van halen. U'll not regret listening to them
03-5-2005||@delarontus i don't think i've heard of Van Halen. oh well i might have listened to his/her/their song without knowing.  @shillout thanks Man. i'll keep it up, u just keep it positive.
03-5-2005|f|Van Halen is a rock group but sometimes they have some slow kinda rock music. Good. Meatloaf is also good.
19-5-2005|m|listen to all kinds of music, depend on the mood. but man'i'm a mostly a hipop personage, followed by the raps, then the r&b, then the jazzes,then rocks(soft rock though), heavy metal drives me up the walls
19-5-2005|f|I like gospels , old blues and country music. All these keeps ur spirit, soul & bodyalive. Hip Hop and Rap are not my kind of music
26-5-2005|f|i luv every kind of music...rap, r 'n b, rock, pop, blues, alternative, oldies...african music...u name it!
29-5-2005|f|I love romantic music. If you're a guy, looking for a good music for your lady, get Lenny le blanc's ALL MY DREAMS. It would take her off her feet. I promise. But make sure you get really familiar with the lyrics and sing to her over and again.
31-5-2005|m|Reggae- Buju Banton, Bob Marley,Barryngton Levy,Eek A Mouse etc Jazz- George Benson, George Howard, Najee, Fela,Lagbaja,Sade etc Hip-Hop-2Pac,Eminem etc R&B-Teddy P, Luther, Freddy Jackson,Anita Baker etc Traditional- Sunny Ade, Manu Dibango  Never sat down to listen to classical music @ Ra & Seun, I doff my hat to you both. Just dont have the patience to listen to it.
03-6-2005|f|I am game for any kind of music, hip-hop, soul, jazz, RnB, classic. odies. rock, gosple, Genre, anything even native songs from different tribes from around the world but it is my mood for them that differs. i have got to be in certain mood to listen to certain music. I could in one hour or two jump from one classification of music to another....  i do like Rock but not heavy metal, i do like linking park sort of rock or nickleback, good charlotte aint bad so it green day, blink 182 anything rock tht is not heavily metallic!!!
06-6-2005|f|It depends on my mood but i love hip-hop and raps and sometimes switch to RnB whenever i'm in high spirit and need to cool my head down.But i prefer hip-hop and rap cos they keep my spirit high anytime i'm low
06-6-2005|f|A friend of mine just introduced me to Latino music (Spanish), my goodness.......... even though I still don't understand most of the songs; it's really lovely listening to the rhythm.
08-6-2005|m|I'm an Afrobeat junkie and good music does something to me that I can't explain...especially the sound of the Sax.  Music is my passion so I feel it's an injustice to name 5 of my favorite artists but for the sake of it - Fela Anikulapo Kuti and Sade are two artists that will always make my list regardless of my mood. While artists like Anita Baker, Kayode Fashola, Sunny Ade, Tracy Chapman, Bob Marley, Lagbaja, Luther Vandross, Femi Kuti (live), Jay-Z, Buju....oooh Buju, Dr. Dre, KWAM1, Obey and others I can't remember will float in and out of my list of favorite artists.  @ Ra - So in your opinion, what does my choice of music say about my personality? I'm curious.
08-6-2005||A friend lent me Morgan Heritage's cd. I think its rasta music, or something like that, but i love it. I like Jill Scott, Erykah Badu and Lauryn Hill. I'm not sure if they all fall into the same type of music.
10-6-2005|m|Y'all need to start listening to some real Hip hop ,Mos def is definately hot and the new Common Album (BE) is an instant classic (props to kanye), I think Nigerian are a lil' soft with the kinda music y'all listen to ,catch myself catching the soft vibe sometime's .Anyway I listen to all sorts of sounds ,Josh Groban is nice to listen to and also b4 I go ,go get the Coldplay album also ,now that's real. Holla at ur boi.
10-6-2005|f|I listen to any good music depending on the mood I am.But an artist like Bryan Mcknight will always keep me going.I can as well mention Ronan Keating,Whitney Houston,R kelly....and lots of them. When it comes to rege I go for Bob Marley...what of Afro musicI go for Abami Eda(Fela Anikulapo). We have so many artists out there and their music passes across diffenrent messages so it really depends on my mood at that moment..but I love music so much,it lifts my soul up when I'm down!
12-6-2005|f|@babadudu, your choice of music does tell me a great deal about you and your person.  You're passionate and deep. You're not the racy type, you enjoy life and are quite mature....... right?
12-6-2005|f|I love Gospel Music. I also love RnB. I love artistes like Whitney Houston, CeCe Winans, MaryMary, Kurt Carr, Celine Dion, Nicole Mullen, Kirk Frankiln, R.Kelly, Jaci Velasquez, Yolanda Adams, Alicia Keys...anything inspiring. I love hearing choirs sing and I tend to buy any album by any choir. And I love some Yoruba gospel musicians too..Tope Alabi, Bola Are.
13-6-2005|f|@Ra: Spanish music is fantastic! You know music is a universal language so sometimes it really doesn't matter when one does not understand the lyrics. I love the rythm, instruments especially the guitar and most of all the dance steps.  @yomidipset4eva: I love Mos Def's raps and his cool attitude in movies. Didn't know about the Common and Coldplay albums but i'll surely listen to them. Its been a while since i listened to new songs. Never heard of Josh Groban! I wonder!!
13-6-2005|m|I'm surprised that we have people who love forms of music outside pop, rock and rap!  Related topic: What are you listening to right now?
22-6-2005|f|R n B. Hip hop and rap
28-6-2005|m|Ur my kinda girl clap! CLAP!! CLAP!!!
28-6-2005|f|Soft rock for me.....U2, Coldplay, Cranberries, Maroon5 ,Linkin Park etc..they do it for me always..especially U2....I have a huge crush on Bono....!  On the Nigerian scene, Age Beeka,Stylplus, Ochanya, Asha....ok these Nigerian musicians (with the exception of Stylplus) are mostly recognised in the nation's capital so I guess ya'all never heard of them before but believe me they are good!
14-4-2005|m|The Peace Talk Double Phone functions both as a normal telephone (which can make calls to local and landline networks like any other phone) and as a 'street intercom'.  According to Barrister Udo Oreye, chairman and CEO of Peace Global Satellite Communications Limited, the company responsible for the service: [I]"In a street where we have about 25 subscribers, we install a telephone at the security post, at the entrance of the street. Then, we do the billing in a configuration, in such a way that amongst the residents, they can be talking to one another as long as they want at N35 per day, that is, N1,000 in a month. "And you may talk for 24 hours in a day and still pay N35. It is not pay as you go or pay per second or per minute".[/I] Sun News Online  You can chat for hours with someone in the same area and only get billed 35 naira. This would be useful for a business which has several branches on the same street. What do you think?
14-4-2005|f|I think it's a most brilliant and fantastic idea and I call your attention to a similar debate re free talktime on mobilenigeria. We're surely going places, we are!
15-4-2005|f|Seun, what is the total cost to get a starcomms line with this feature?
15-4-2005|m|Angelgirl, I don't think the phone can work with a Starcomms line. Peace Global Satellite Communications Limited is a licensed PTO on its own, just like Starcomms. I don't think there's any PTO that sells SIM cards yet.  I can't find any information about this company online, beyond the fact that they are a PTO licensed by the NCC.
15-4-2005|f|Sorry, i didnt get your earlier post, i thought someone mentioned starcomms
15-4-2005|f|Hmm..... thats nice. Does anyone know just how they intend to bill at such low rate?
15-4-2005|m|The phone probably has the ability to operate like a walkie-talkie (direct transmission of radio waves between one phone and another)
17-4-2005||Ahem... this topic is not about mobile phones. It does seem out of place in this section.  Or am I missing something?
19-4-2005|m|Choose one of the following: - I can give this 'Mobile Phone' forum a new name: 'Communications', 'Telephony' or 'Phones' - I can move topics like this to the 'Technology' Section.  Which would you suggest?
19-4-2005|m|The first option will be a better idea and I kinda prefer the name phones  More ideas
08-9-2009||My People, let us no mislead ourselves and let us stop preying on each others IGNORANCE!  The facility/SERVICE is called "PUSH-TO TALK" and it comes enabled in most phones (represented by an icon, two phones placed side-by-side, in a Nokia5200 for example)  Its is FREE if and when the Provider you use, ENABLES IT ON THEIR NETWORK!  Our PTO's are just too greedy they would not enable such SERVICE on their Network but l bet that one "Naija Business man" can arrange with them for a fee, to offer the free service to our people for a fee!  We should demand that the PTO's enable this service for us, not jumping up and down to pay for it.  Of course, we should also bear in mind that it has the tendency to REDUCE the Income of the PTO's but then, somethings are just Immoral, like being forced to pay-call a Mobile just to pass info to your cousin at the next house!  My 10Cents.
14-4-2005|m|Let's start with a statement by Barrister Udo Oreye, CEO of the Peace Talk Double Phone people: "I remember vividly telling the bank officials that the issue of interconnectivity was like the marriage they used to have in Ebele, a village in Edo State, where I hail from. There, a girls parents would be approached for their hands in the marriage of their daughter. And after the discussions and all that, but unknown to the girl, as she is on her way to the market, some people will just pick her up, kidnap her, and take her to the husbands house. She will shout and shout, saying she doesnt like the man.  But eventually, older women will come out to say that the same way you were picked up on the way to the market was how we were picked up too and we now have kids. And that marriage by force worked."  Now what stops the parents from discussing with the daughter before accepting the proposal?
14-4-2005|f|Had they discussed the proposal with their daughters, it would not have been called arranged marriages. In my home town, Ibadan, wives were 'married' in the same barbaric way. The funny thing however is that these marriages lasted and the couples seemed happy enough. That much can not be said of the majority of marriages that obtain today. Reason being that before parents of both parties can mutually agree to give their daughters hand in marriage to those asking for it, they must have studied the groom's/bride's family, as the case may be and be certain to a very reasonable extent that the man will make their daughter a very good husband and vice versa. No parent will give their daughter's hand in marriage to any man who is short of responsible or lacks good character. Although, to every rule there is an exception. There must have existed cases where the marriages turned out less than perfect but family involvement and expectations restrained the man from out rightly misbehaving and equally compelled the woman to live up to her expectations. With the grand entrance of civilisation however, things have changed significantly.  For the better or otherwise remains to be decided. Today boy meets girl on the road, in church, in school, at a party, wherever and one thing leads to the other. They court for a while and eventually meet the parents. Whether or not the boy has spells of mental incapacitation when it rains, no one knows. If the girl finds it difficult to stay with one man, it is unknown to everyone. Are we better off now in making independent choices or then when partners were arranged by parents with their children's best interests at heart?  There are downsides and there are positive sides, it is however unclear which outweighs the other.
15-4-2005|m|In other words, you think it is ok for a woman to be forced into marriage by her parents.  Women.  Please don't let me hear you talk about 'female emancipation' tommorrow!
15-4-2005|f|Roll your eyes all you want, my dear. How typical of a guy to read my post out of context!  I am not supporting the barbaric notion of forcing a woman into marriage. Never! I was simply stating that in the days when parents arranged for a certain young and upwardly mobile man, whose family they had thoroughly scrutinised and found worthy of their daughter, to have her hand in marriage, marriages lasted and couples seemed much happier than what obtains these days.  Like it or not, the family one marries into matters almost as much, if not much more, than the individual one is marrying. His/her family, to a reasonable extent, makes or mares your marriage. In a nutshell, I was suggesting that it's better for all parties concerned to know the kind of family one is marrying into, be aware of their strong points and shortcomings (there is no perfect family) and be ready to live happily ever after. That sure sounds better to me than not-too-pleasant surprises springing up in marriages and all.  Capische?
16-4-2005|m|The old arranged family is more or less family affairs. That is, two families were getting married and not just a man and a woman. So, in this case, the young woman has no say in this matter. If her parents decided that she is going to marry a particular man, she has no say in the matter. If she refused, her resistance will soon be overpowered, or she will simply be abducted toi her husband's house.  And surprisingly, the forced or arranged marriage works for them, as postulated by Ra. This is because the women then had little or no education, and so they are not as exposed as today's women. Also, the women had been taught total submission to their husband as the head of the home. And may I add also, the woman will not want to disgrace the family she came from by making things difficult for her husband. It doesn't matter whether she loves him now or not. The love will come later, or they will grow up loving each other.  I don't succumb to that form of marriage nowadays. Anyway it can't happen again as today's women are more enlightened and had found their voice against men dominated world. If a parent want their daugther to marry a particular man, let them discuss it with her in a gentle and loving manner, and avoid forcing the man on her if she eventually refused.  I must make haste to say that the insight and wisdom of parents in marriage matter is still invaluable nowadays. Any man or woman that ignores parental counselling and guidance in the issue of marriage does it at his or her own perils.
16-4-2005|m|It is possible that those marriages did not work as well as you people are saying. People tend to look at the past through rose-colored glasses. The fact that a marriage does not end in divorce does not mean it is working. Or is it?  Parents are not necessarily unbiased judges of character; it is quite easy to have children and grow up without learning some basic things. However, if they are going to [I]meddle[/I] in your marital life then maybe things will turn out much better if they are in full support of your spouse. Which is the case if they are the one that picked him/her!
09-6-2005|f|sometimes it the parents plan to force child to marry someone "cos theere rich and thta does not really work
06-7-2005|m|Forced marriage isn't good> it ends up in chaos. There won't be love and affection.

04-1-2011|f|Do they still practice this nonsense? In Nigeria?
15-4-2005|m|Formerly 'N[/b]ational [b]E[/b]lectric [b]P[/b]ower [b]A[/b]uthority' Also known as: '[b]N[/b]ever [b]E[/b]xpect [b]P[/b]ower [b]A[/b]lways' Now '[b]P[/b]ower [b]H[/b]olding [b]C[/b]ompany of [b]N[/b]igeria ([b]PHCN)'  Allafrica: [I]"The Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE), yesterday named the Power Holding Company of Nigeria (PHCN), as the new government incorporated body that will take over all assets and liabilities of the National Electric Power Authority (NEPA), preparatory to the full privatisation of electricity generation and distribution in the country."[/I]  Does it really matter?
15-4-2005|m|No, it doesn't matter. A change of name does not necessarily means an improvement in perofrmance.  Remember the time the The Nigerian Police downed their former black uniform for the present one? They still remain the same inefficient and corrupt organisation. So, NEPA or PHCN still means the same organisation. What they really need to change is their modus operandi and not their name.
15-4-2005|f|The Electric Power Sector Act 2005, which the President signed into law last month focuses mainly on restructuring/unbundling of NEPA,......, creation of a regulatory body that will licence and regulate the generation, transmission, distribution and supply of electricity.In addition, the Act will provide for the determination of tariff.  I so wish that with the new Act, whether with a change of name or not(cos it does not matter), things really turn out to be a lot more better and enjoyable. There is so much corruption going on in there. Come to think of it, we pay exorbitant bills,(sometimes fixed monthly charges), for services not rendered, maintainance fees for meters are paid monthly, and when you meter is faulty, you are completely on your own!
20-5-2005|f|The deal is sealed, from the 1st of July, Nepa will be 'christained' Power holding company of Nigeria. But guys, so what will happen when there is power outage and it is eventually restored, most of say 'up Nepa'; with the change of name what do we say? [b]'up Power holding'? or 'up PHCN'[/b]is going to be pretty tough adjusting, don't you think?
20-5-2005|f|Yes o, infact people will hardly recognise the name as being changed to PHCN, especially among the younger children who are more used to screaming UP NEPA!!!
20-5-2005|m|I think it's not the change of name that is unique rather it is the re-organisation and privatisation that will bring about revolution. A new rebirth of Power generation in our nation and I believe if privatised improvement will be witnessed though it may be a bit expensive in the beginning but we will witness a new dawn of power generation and as time goes on the power of monopoly will be broken becos of private coys competition.
20-5-2005|m|Lest I forget Power Holder will no longer hold our power ,I hope.
25-5-2005|m|It is important to increase the generated power. The whole of Nigeria is now using less than 4000 megawatts, when we are supposed to have about 25,000 megawatts for the Nigerian consumption.  I dont know whether the new name company would be able to generate even 10,000 MW, so that Nigerians will know that they are using new company.
26-5-2005|f|at least let there be an impact of the name change shey?
13-6-2005|m|I think, and hope, the new change is also a change in structure as a step towards privitasation or liberlisaton of the industry
24-6-2005|m|Don't be deceived by OBJ's changing of NEPA- National Electric Power Authority(Never Expect Power Always) name to (PHCN) Power Holding Company of Nigeria and go and sell your generator if you have one. Infact, it is nothing but a hoarse, a camouflage and ordinary change of nomencleature to deceive the easy trusting Nigerians.The true meaning of the new acronym by a reliable source in the power sector is (Problem Has Changed Name). So be Aware.
24-6-2005|m|[move]The change in name means nothing if there is no change in the humans behind the name!!![/move]
26-6-2005|m|I think the new name means Please hold Candle, Now.  But either way, its a good step, though I hope they dont totally make the energy secor private. Thats just an idea by the IMF that has never worked anywhere else in the world. They only try that in the 3rd world. Even in the uS where I live, the energy sector is heavily subsitidies and regulated byt he government.
28-7-2005|m|This morning i received this offline from a friend.  Don't be deceived by OBJ's changing of NEPA- National Electric Power Authority(NEVER EXPECT POWER ALWAYS) name to (PHCN) Power Holding Company of Nigeria and go & sell ur gen. if u av one.Infact it is noting but a hoarse, a camouflage and ordinary change of nomencleature to deceive d easy trusting Nigerians. D true meaning of d new acronym by a reliable source in d power sector is (PROBLEM HAS CHANGED NAME).So be Aware.  Do you think the above statement is correct or not, share your opinion fast.
28-7-2005|m|I at least expected someone to congratulate the power sector first Anyways sha, action is what we need not a mere change of nomenclature.  But then, I wish them the very best and don't forget it's gonna be followed by mass retrenchment from the former NEPA as new hands would be brought in.
28-7-2005|m|We must all expect the same reform that happened in the telecom sector in the power sector too. At least we all can see what privatization of GSM has done to the country, am quite optimistic that the power sector won't be different too.
03-8-2005|f|why did they change NEPA's name? Weird. Besides they r all Fake. I'll still stand on the fact that, if there are private ownership of electricity in NIgeria, the rate at which there will be power supply for everyone will increase. WHen the electricy is handled by private ownerships, there will be competition for the best.
03-8-2005|m|yes, but it shouldnt still be heavily regulated. even in the US, the private companies are not allowed to charge over a certain price
03-8-2005|f|Yeah i know...but at least they should still privatalize NEPA.
03-8-2005|m|Is like you are not current with latest developement as regard the power sector in Nigeria.  PHCN is only a care-taking body, and they are the one to manage the technical and management of the defunt NEPA till when private companies come on board.  What they are doing now is to see that most of the equipments are in good shape so as to increase "dead NEPAs" monetary value to would be buyers. They will also see to the demobilization of current NEPA/PHCN staffs.  PHCN is not just a name change, it's just a care-taking body.
04-8-2005|f|Stop speaking english.  I am saying that the whole ELECTRICYT in NIgerian shouldn't be handled by ONly the government. NEPA or PHCL or Watever.  Electricity companies should be many in NIgeria---private ones for that matter.
04-8-2005|m|What the govt. want to do is to break NEPA/PHCN into various units (GenCo = Generation Company, TransCo = Transmission Companies, DisCo = Distribution Companies).  Each of these are divided according to the geo-political zones and private operators will take over the runnning of the various units.
04-8-2005|m|How anyone thought of how easy it would be to actually privatise NEPA? The reason I'm saying this is that NEPA is more complicated than some of us know.  To make you understand better. Generating stations generate the power in megawatts and passed on to Transmitting station that carries out this massive energy to other states, cities etc and then finally to Distributing stations who now bring it to the end users.  If NEPA is to be privatised, can these stations be disengaged from each other?
04-8-2005|m|It's damn possible to separate them. NEPA problem is as a result of it unwieldy nature.  What the govt want to do now is to create Gencos, Transcos and Discos. The Gencos will see to the generation and maintenance of power from the power stations, the Transco will be responsible for the transmission of the generated power, i think the govt. is not privatizing the transmission though ( is stand to be corrected here), the Discos are the one that will make final delivery to end users.  So as a a Disco you can buy power from any Genco of your choice and resell to the end users.  This way i think the problem of a single company running a big entity like NEPA will be abolished.
04-8-2005|m|I just hope this works out fine but I bet you it's not gonna be as easy as the Telecoms sector.  Anyhow sha, I sure hope for the best.
05-8-2005|f|What the govt. want to do is to break NEPA/PHCN into various units (GenCo = Generation Company, TransCo = Transmission Companies, DisCo = Distribution Companies).  Each of these are divided according to the geo-political zones and private operators will take over the runnning of the various units.  You r still speaking english. I am saying The Electricity shouldn't be handled by the Government. NO Government at all.
05-8-2005|m|FROM MY EARLIER POST:  Each of these are divided according to the geo-political zones and private operators will take over the runnning of the various units.
05-8-2005|f|The private Operators, are being paided and owned by the government.  I am Talking about Allowing people that has nothing to do with government to handle the power supply.
05-8-2005|m|It will be nice if you can mobilize the masses to form a consortium, there will be an IPO on the NSE.  This will really give POWER to the PEOPLE.
05-8-2005|f|LOL. LOL. Why am i laughing you ask?? That made me laugh... why is the 'power' in bold? OMG i am cracking up.. lol. lol
05-8-2005|f|Okay now back to my point, it'd be nice if they can have private people operate power supply. Seriously. When there are private owners/managments of electricity (power supply), there'll be competition for the best.
05-8-2005|m|A name change for the bleeding company doesn't make a difference at all. When they break the company up, then we can start talking...
15-4-2005|m|A lot of Nigerian TV stations show foreign comedies (typically American) from time to time. Others get to watch these comedies on locally available digital satellite TV. What are your favorite foreign comedies?  The comedies I love the most are: 'Friends': Joey the struggling actor, Rachel the pretty thing, Ross the professor and 'most married man' in the show, Monica the control freak, Chandler her 'joker' husband, and Phoebe, the massage therapist and author of the infamous 'Smelly Cat' song.  'Dharma and Greg' 8.30pm every Friday on STV (Silverbird Television). I love Dharma because she accepts everybody and everything. Greg because Dharma's antics haven't driven him crazy - yet!  'My Wife and Kids' In my opinion, the only black comedy that is actually funny - sometimes.  The Comedies I don't like that much: 'Martins' I hate most black comedies. The 'Bernie Mac' Show: Did I mention hating most black comedies?
15-4-2005|f|@Seun, that's funny becasue the really funny commedies are black comedies. In my opinion, at least.  My wife and kids: I find really hilarious most of the time. I constantly pray not be unfortunate enough to have a dumb kid like junior.  Eve: While not so funny, is really nice  Half and half: I think the 2 mothers are really insane  The others elude me now, work and all......  be back shortly
15-4-2005|m|my favourite shows are  Seinfeld: I like the cranky Kramer  Friends:I like Ross because in spite of being so smart academically, he can be quite dumb. I like Joey too  Frasier: Niles is very funny. he is always trying to appear dignified and ends up falling on his face.  I like Bernie Mac cos of the boy(can't remember his name)
16-4-2005||I like a whole lot of american commedies because they keep me laughing. when watching em most peeps who see me but don't dig the show will be like "is this guy mad?". anyway among my favourites are  the simpsons..although it's a cartoon one on one the parkers that 70's show the drew carey show malcolm in the middle  can't remember any other right now. peace!
02-5-2005|m|Hey Seun, do you miss out of the fun, or do you miss out of the fun?  Man, those black brodas and sisters are the funny guys. I have not seen a funny white fellow after Frank Spencer (Some Mothers Do Have Them) and Rowan Atkinson (Mr. Bean)
02-5-2005|f|Now Mr. Bean is completely out of this world. He is exceptionally good at what he does. If you've seen Johnny English, you'll understand what I mean.
02-5-2005|m|Yeah. I remember Frank Spencer. Those two belong to the same category of comedy, but I've forgotten what it's called.
29-5-2005|m|There are so many foreign comedies that are really great, unfortunately most of them are on dstv which is just sad. I personally love  Six feet under - Its amazing how a series set around a funeral home could be so funny! Malcom in the middle - excellent to watch Joey - Not as good as friends, but a good substitute with quite a number of laughs Two and a half men - you'll definitely laugh at this one Half and Half - They are all insane especially the mothers Eve - good all fashioned black comedy, not too bad or as bad as some judge it Scrubs - One of my personal favourites, highly original, extremely funny, I have seasons 1-3 on dvd, its insane, you'll nearly die laughing.  Can't think of the others right now, but one things for sure, there are good shows out there
29-5-2005|m|I forgot to mention the Bill Cosby Show. Definitely one black movie that I think is funny.
30-5-2005|f|Anyone knows if Taina is still aired on any channel? Used to be on Nicklodeon.
31-5-2005|f|i love my wife and kids, taina, bill cosby show, becker, the parkers, thats all . and yes taina is still aired on LTV but i have forgotten d actual time
06-6-2005|f|Hmmm Seun...did you get to see The Jeffersons and Good Times back in the days? Now those were really funny black comedies.
08-6-2005|m|I must go with seun on this, I do not really like black comedies.  My fave show was Seinfeld, I loved the character of George in that. Currently I like Malcom in the Middle and the Office.
09-6-2005|f|I saw a nigerian commedy recently and I almost cracked my ribs with mirth. Goodness! Those guys are good. It's entitled A Night of a Thousand Laughs with a group of stand-up comedians. My favourites were some really young guy called Basket Mouth and another guy who seems perpetually drunk (that's his trade-mark, I guess).  I really enjoyed it.
09-6-2005|m|I have seen that and I loved it as well, my favourite was the one called "I go die" he was always dissing warri!  I have 4 different ones, are there more than four?
09-6-2005|f|Ra, that guy with the drunken act is called Clint the drunk....
22-6-2005|f|I love all UPN shows. I love half and half so much, i love eve so much.
23-6-2005|m|comedy- Martin Lawrence
04-7-2005|f|As far as I'm concerned the crack very dry jokes and the amazing thing is that they actually laugh at them, when as far as I'm concerned they are boring,i very much agree with you Seun hat the funny comedians are black and i must say African.
07-7-2005|f|Seun don't tell me you are a racist too!!!!! coupled with the virginity.  I think both black and white comedies are really funny . My favorites however are Fresh prince of Bel air( really old but don't ever miss to watch it on go channel 84), like eve , friends and veronica's closet. not forgetting our very own papa ajasco.
07-7-2005|f|Why is everyone calling seun a virgin?? Please leave (my) seun alone.
25-7-2005|f|I love friends and fat albert
05-10-2005||even now am smiling has i read the opinons of other peeps about the comedies i so so like. plus kenan and kel.
07-10-2005|m|I love eve. Its a really nice black comedy...
11-10-2005|f|Seun, you hate The Bernie Mac Show? my brother will strangle you just jokin i love that show, it's wicked. I love the following shows: Everybody loves Raymond The Parkers Will and Grace Reba Roseanne Girlfriends That 70's show In living colour[ dat's old skool, but i luv it] Jamie foxx show Family Guy[stewie's sick ] there's a whole lot

12-10-2005|m|you mean Parker is good, don't tell me that, what annoys me is her obsession with professor and each season this obsession still goes on, it makes no sense. its just slow
12-10-2005|f|It's fun actually and she eventually got married to the professor. see, obsession works
14-10-2005|f|everybody loves raymond's good, the parkers'good, reba's good, that's 70's show's good, i can't stand bernie Mac, Family Guy's the best. (something about RI to be proud of !)

15-4-2005|m|From Technology Times: [I]"The Nigerian Communications Commission, in line with section 53 (1) of the Nigerian Communications Act, has on April 7, 2004 issued a Direction to Globacom Limited demanding the payment of a penalty of 34 million Naira to the Commission for flagrantly refusing to reconnect certain private telecom operators 24 days after the expiration of the seven-day period within which to comply"[/I] (NCC Head of Public Affairs, Dave Imoko)  The PTOs in question are XPT, ITN and Disc Communications Limited (Discom).
15-4-2005|f|Whoah this is serious!
16-4-2005|m|What's going to happen to the money when it's paid
17-4-2005|m|Oh, and by the way, if they continue disobeying the order they wil be fined 1 million naira more per day!
17-4-2005|m|Globacom knows the rule and the law of NCC. I do not think they will refuse to pay.
19-4-2005|m|The money goes to NCC and then what?
19-4-2005|m|That's an interesting question. I have no idea where the money goes. Does NCC use all this money for its regulatory activities? Is telecom regulation really that expensive?
20-4-2005|m|Do not forget that this is another way of income for the Government. The money will be accounted for as at when due. Like the inland revenue and other agencies.
22-4-2005|m|Hm... sorry I am just replying this. I am just surprised at the turn of events. I still dont understand why NCC is deciding to make GLOBACOM the scapegoat. There had been cases of disconnection in the past and NCC didn't do anything about it. I just hope that they are doing this with good fate. Anyway, time will tell...
23-2-2009|m|Globacom knows d rule I'm sure they will pay the fine to avoid embarashment
15-4-2005|m|What do you tell a skinny guy who wants to body-build but is quite choosy with foods and doesn't like to exercise? (thats not exactly true, his own form of exercise is a stroll to the cafe or a walk from his room to the TV and back.)
15-4-2005|m|I'm also interested in this information. Is it possible to build up my muscles without actually spending precious hours in the gym? I mean, there's no gym near our house; using a gym regularly will drain both time and money. So if there's a way to get built-up while sitting in fromt of my computer, I want to know!
15-4-2005|f|Seun, smart as you are, I'm sure you know the answer to that already......erm..... NO!  Unless you're all set to start pumping steroid tablets, I see no way you can build muscles while sitting in front of your computer.  As per what to tell a skinny boy.....well, nothing really, if it's genetic. Some people don't reach their full physical potential till they're well into their 30s. Always assuming your dietary habits are healthy, mind.  You don't necessarily have to go to the gym to be fit. Nothing wrong with good old jogging. Thrice, maybe twice a week, wake up an hour earlier than normal and jug round your street, get your heart rate up and jump start your metabolism for the day. Get some dumb-bells for your arms and chest muscles. You can manufacture yours like my brother used to or simply buy some, they're reasonably priced, I believe. One important factor though, you must know that guys burn up fat much faster than women. testosterone and all. Consequently, itll really help a growing guy (0-25 or thereabout) who doesnt want to be skinny, if he maintains a very healthy diet and eats at least three generous meals a day.  kodewrita, it's alright to be choosy, but the meals you like, do them justice and I've realised that inventing your own cuisine. It makes meal time exciting. It does get pretty boring having to choose between rice, beans, amala, eba and pounded yam all the time.  Well guys, hope that helped.
16-4-2005||What do you tell him? Get a life and start lifting them weights!  I used to be quite skinny, but then I became a gyming freak and now I'll say I'm a little above average. I would have been much more muscular if I was dedicated to gyming, but you know how procrastination works. Definately in life I want to be built and fit ... like my idol: P.Diddy.  I call him the Ultimate Nig*a. He's physically built, got the dough, chicks, into music, film, business, got a child, having fun, respected in the US by both politicain (vote or die stuff), serious minded folks and light hearted folks alike. I mean what else could you want in life?
16-4-2005|m|He has all these wonderful things yet he can't hold on to a wife. [I]continued at Why do Celebrities have Relationship and Marital Problems?[/I]
17-4-2005|f|Oh, this is interesting, because my friend's boyfriend was skinny and she got him to gain some weight and pump up some muscle. Well sad to say there is no other way than to go to the gym and lift some weights. Going on a protein diet also helps a lot!!!!
05-7-2005|f|No steriods. It's dangerous.
05-7-2005|m|Steroids? Thanks but no thanks. I plan to have kids and steroids will not help that. As for junk food or carbs well that means the morsel foods again (ooowwww )
27-7-2005|m|What to tell a skinny guy? Sing to him  We love steroids, We love steroids, We love steroids.  and i promise he wont be much sinny again.  Just joking sha. I think the gym is a good idea
17-8-2005|m|Nothing good comes easy  Get your butt to the gym (or get the gym to u). U can't build real muscles without gymin. When u lift 'em weights u r buildin strenght as well. U don't get strength with steriods. D formular is this: liftin weight tears the muscles and eatin well replaces the "space". Result? growth.  Its not the dog in the fight but the fight in the dog that matters.  Even if u only want to shape up (for them girls) u still have to work out. The word is work-out, not exercise. The rate @ which we gain defers but its worth the stress anyway because when u've got it, u've got it. Muscles don't shrink back. U don't build six packs with joggin or strolling.  Sit down in front of the comp all days..u'll still build. yeah! u'll build finger muscles (carpals)  Steriods have adverse side effects.
19-8-2005|m|Go to wharf and carry bags of rice, cement, beans or go to building sites and carry blocks and concretes (konkere) Just joking you know.  Like every other person's said, the gym would help if you've got the money or time.
20-8-2005|f|I was watching[i] made[/i] on MTV, And they were simply making a skinny guy into a guy with nice muscles and hot pacs. They had just 3 months to complete the mission. The guys weight was 130 pounds. (i can't do math now..turn it to nigerian...thingy).  The guy had to eat boiled eggs, food that are healthy, and eat alot. Just keep eating healthy foods for like the first 5 days. Then go to the gym and do light weight lifting, keep your eating routine and keep the weight lifting going on. I am sure it will work,....because to my greatest suprise, the guy that weighed 130 pounds weighed, 168 pounds after the show, he had great muscles and nice pacs. And yeah..his body was built.. i liked him. You can do it, just eat normally and exercise (mostly weight lifting) equally. Good luck skinny guy!
20-8-2005|m|i was skinny untill i got to 9th and started lifting weight set. You gat to be consistent with the weight lifting coz if you aint, seriously notin happens.
20-8-2005|f|my brother is really really skinny. i mean skinny. it's funny 'cause he eats like crazy.
20-8-2005|m|most skinny guys eat alot.
20-8-2005|f|Not just skinny guys. My friend is skinny, you can mold her with both of my legs and have a remainder. She eats like crazy!!!!! She eats and eats, and her tommy still looks flat. She scares the sh!t outta me. I dunno why that is.
20-8-2005|m|but seriously if the brother likes the way he is i will advice you to not pressure him into anything . coz , some skinny people are due to nature and some pretty gurls are turned on by this.. Let the brother be, if he likes himself fine. dont disturb yourself.
20-8-2005|f|i think the high metabolism is a family thing becaue he weighs like 60 pounds and that's more than what i weigh at his age. my best friend too is skinny she's vegetarian (some indian religious thing) she 89 pounds.  i don't think he likes his weight but it really don't matter now. he's only 11.
20-8-2005|m|aight
20-8-2005|f|Ur bro is 60 pounds. I am guessing he is not yet 13. Anyways just eat healthy and you'll be fine. So as not to have eating disorder.
20-8-2005|m|Wellsaid hot-angel. Eat healthy food. All ectomorphs are hard gainers. A mesomorph will gain muscles easily than an ectomorph because an ectomorph's system is wasteful (by nature). Excess foods are burned off as heat. U have to train it to accept d excess food and turn them to muscles or fat whichever u want. So for the ectomorph(skinny guy). Eat Like Monique and workout like Arnold.
21-8-2005|f|Wow. Microbiology student. Ectomorph and mesomorph. hahaha.
21-8-2005|m|Na me be dat o! My papa money no waste. Owo o easy men!. Its anatomy anyway

22-8-2005|m|Amin Ashe! (amen)
22-8-2005|m|well as an ex-skinny guy, my advice is this,  1, rest well. 2, eat well too, u could use mulitivatamin drugs to enhance your appetite. 3, just do light work outs, like curls, push ups, and triceps builds. (they dont av to come regular) just anytime you feel like is okay, but make it a lil frequent for a start. probably once a day b4 bathing.. 4. Avoid too much off stressfull activities during the day, 5. talk less, think less and try to sleep deep at nights. try that for 1-2 months there sure should be a diff. except you av be evil spelled by ur late great grand mother to remain a skinny bone 4 life  the body builds and excercise would be too stressfull and more like a rush, just keep it simple, and track your weight frequently, when you notice a change, it gives you more encouragement..
22-8-2005|m|@y'all thanks.  @DE-King Now i know you don't like me. You haven't seen all those bag-lifters afterhours. Their backs are permanently bent as if they are carrying something. just kidding.  Well i am 5 foot 9(and increasing) and i seem to grow lengthwise instead of horizontally. That might be a reason.
22-8-2005|f|Kodewrita, you got some kisses for making me laugh.
23-8-2005||a guy being skinny may be as a result of malnutrition .in that case he is adviced to go for a balance diet. it may also be as a result of womanizing,in that case he should play safe cos AIDS is real.
23-8-2005|f|Go meme. Welcome to Nairaland hun. I am sure you'll enjoy your stay here. Create your profile and add your pictures.
23-8-2005|m|Very wrong!  People fall under ectomorph, mesomorph and endomorph in terms body clasifications . No matter how much/good the ectomorphs eat. Its takes time to show. They are simply hard (weight) gainers.
25-8-2005|m|@hot_angel you just made my day. i am going to buy more time and spend it blowing kisses. Just kidding but any way  @layi thanks for supporting me with scientific facts, someone just insinuated that i am drying up cos of womanising (read HIV).

16-4-2005||[I]continued from Re: What do you tell a Skinny Guy?[/I]  Well, one thing about being a celebrity is that marriage doesn't come easy. whether you're a man or woman. You'll meet tons of women and men but the problem is that most times they'll love you for what you are (a star) and not for who you are (your plain self without all the cash).  So it's nice once in a while as a celebrity/popular person to meet someone who doesn't even know you're famous or exist and get that person to fall in love with, then you know you've scored big time. I guess that's what he and a lot of guys there are facing. Believe you me, I know fully well what I'm saying because I've had the experience.  I met this chick on Easter Sunday, and you know I was with my ride and I had some cash to spare...plus my flow was good (as 50 said I told the chick whatever she wanted to hear). you bet I got her, but man sustaining such a relationship was just beyond me. because she had this kind of notion that I'm a rich guy...and I ain't like that man.  Anyway I wish everybody finds true love in their life time. P.Diddy's affair with Jennifer Lopez didn't last because he had a criminal charge then and J.Lo's family thought it was best for them to split as her music career was just taking off then. You know they wanted the 100% positivity thing for her, but P.Diddy can get any girl he wants right now. It's just to get the right one.
17-4-2005|m|Look , the problem there is that there is no love in the first place. the lady or the man which ever way is there just because of the riches or becuase you are a star. and secondly, there is no care or attention due to the nature of work, business or duty from the man or woman in which ever way from both.
17-4-2005|m|Successful Businessmen are usually much, much richer than music/movie/TV stars, and yet they often have long, healthy marriage. Bill gates, the richest man in the world, is quite happily married. If you look at the divorce rate among the 40 richest people in the world, it is not much different from the divorce rate in the general population.  If rich businessmen who are hundreds of times richer than Puff Daddy can stay married, why can't Puff Daddy stay married? No, the problem is not their money. When you subtract the expenses of their celebrity lifestyle, how much do they have left? And do they even know how to manage the money?  I think the problem is the stress level of their work. Afterall doctors are reputed to be the professionals with the highest divorce rate. Maybe they have no time to develop emotional maturity.
17-4-2005|f|One of the failures are the press and fans. They start spreading gossip and then the whole thing escalates. And then they are pressured by the press and paparazzis. I mean but if they really love each other they should not let themsleves be driven to destruction but we are all humans and have our weakness. It is only the stongest that survive. That is why I love celebrities that sticks with the same partner.
09-5-2005|m|I quite agree with Chigszy, but sometimes celebrities are surrounded by too many people who pretend to love them. And this may make the celebrity to be confused and thereby marry the wrong person who may later on, seek for a divorce (by that time, perhaps, he may have equally made himself popular by marrying a celebrity) .
18-9-2005|f|I don't think they marry for love. It's always a 60 year old lady getting married to the 21 year old guy. they marry 4 money usually. anything that'll get them more wealth like they don't got enough.
31-12-2005|f|If one starts off with flash in the beginnings of a relationship then that is what you have to maintain, now if you start off really being yourself and truthful then everything else will fall in place. Yep there will still be some issues because we all have our opinions on different matters but do what is in your heart and try to let things flow naturally. If a person is going to like you then so be it and if not move on especially if you're looking for more than a play thing (this applies to men and women). Money is important but it isn't everything!!!! Neither is celebrity status.
03-1-2006|m|I in person will never want to marry a celebrity 4 wat ever reason. Unless the person is really ready to face problems in his life by struggling with alot of such advances, they themselfs are not faithfull to themselfs not to talk of being faithfull 2 their spouses n that gets them into divorce marriage divorce marriage. Another thing is that most celebreties are filled with pride cos they feel they will always find someone 2 hookup with, they are always not submissiver 2 their apouses.
07-1-2006|f|Insecurities, jealousies, extremely busy lives, a little bit of selfishness, seeing 'better' ppl out there.
07-1-2006|f|thing is,most celebrities walk with their head in the clouds...
07-1-2006|f|Oh, yeah, and pride!!!
20-2-2006|f|they al feel really big to be treated anyhow afterall they are celebrities
20-2-2006|f|i think all relationships have their problems but celebrities have theirs publicised more because well, they are stars and more in the face of the world. i really dont think they have a higher share of relationship difficulties. they dont have to be stars before being proud and all that.
20-2-2006|m|I have wondered about this issue before now- o. Honestly I don't know. May be pride on the sides of the celebrities.
20-2-2006|m|Celebrities maariage never last, do they?  Have you seen SHREK (Movie) before, there the DONKEY let you know how celebrity marriage is  They dont, simply because of PRIDE. tell them to go to hell with their pride. It Sucks!
17-1-2007|m|Some so-called christian stars face such ''challenges'' too. I just finished reading some stuff about the separation and divorce of popular gospel artiste and star, Amy Grant. A bit of insight into why she evetually broke up with her then husband, Gary Chapman, after more than 16 years of marriage reveals such things as intolerance, infidelity, lust, and above all pride.  Her divorce sent a once beautiful and respected family reputation down the drain.
18-1-2007|m|Wish Beyonce Knowles will break up with JayZ so I will keep fantasizing about her like a single lady , LOL Kidding. I wish them luck  Well to hell with Beyonce cos I got a replacement, little girl Leona Lewis
19-1-2007|f|that wan concern them.
03-6-2007|m|u either choose btw family or fame, u cat have both at the same time, thats whats up
03-6-2007|m|u cant have both , i heard B is tryin to keep jay -z , with all the beating and asx whipping j is giving her, so muhc for irreplacable /, only God knows who reaslly needs to br upgraded //lol
04-6-2007|m|celebrities and failed relationships/marriages.  personallly i think stars live for the moment and marriages/relationships are eternal.  they live in massive cribs expected of them and date pple of their so called status. they hardly have time to sort out whats real and what is not, most of them cant grasp the word sacrifice or trade-off. alot of them are hedonistic (believing life is all about pleasure) and they constantly need the attention of pple like you and i to make them believe they are larger than life. i dont think its all that important to them and not pple who truly care about them to let them know they are special. for them, its just anotha something they gotta do.
07-8-2007|m|Well, as for the celebrity couples, i believe they really don't value their union as much as they value what they do on screen and for the singles, they tend to have this feeling that they are sowing to a greater hight and marriage to them is like an obstacle in achieving that hight. it just unfortunate.
18-9-2007|m|love . commitment and weeding to sell movies are difference things
18-9-2007|m|simple you can have it all, you win some,you lose some, there is always a price to be paid for everything in life.
30-3-2009|m|@ poster!! they all see their fame as their marriage. To them, nothing can come in-between even if the couples wedd in church, they can easily get divorce. what a life
17-4-2005|f|moved from Football or Soccer Fans in Nigeria: Introduction  @Seun and all Man U 'lovers' , Man U is about to play Newcastle (match starts in 5 minutes). As much as I want the impossible to happen, I'm afraid Man U is about to make mince meat of NC. Let's sit back and watch. I'll be back shortly (2 hours actually) with the details.
17-4-2005|m|Our soccer fan[atic]s,  You can update this thread from time to time when something interesting happens in the match! As you know I don't usually follow club soccer, but I'm watching this thread and if I stumble accross any relevant web links I'll participate too.
17-4-2005|f|Well, I predicted mince meat and that was what NC got. Man U polished off the match at 4-1. So, battle of the Titans next month Man U Vs Arsenal, promises to be super duper interesting!
17-4-2005|m|Well, "my" Arsenal boys deserve to have some competition!
20-4-2005|f|Arsenal 0: Chelsea 0. Get this though Man U 0: Everton 1  Anyways, so it's still 11 points ahead of us by Chelsea but it was a really tough match. Although I must say Denise B. seems to be running on low steam these days.
28-4-2005||the season is actually over but then we still have the fa cup final to look forward to. it should be a good end to a otherwise unpredictable season  The champs league is still there and hoooray: the world cup is coming soon!!
28-4-2005|m|We need to get our sports forum organized!
18-2-2006|m|everyone knows arsenal will win,
18-2-2006|m|For God sake, when did Manchester united play Newcastle in "UEFA CUP" ?
22-2-2006|m|Im confused! Man Utd finished bottom of their champioins leauge group so they did not qualify for the UEFA (not EUFA!) cup. Newcastle were knocked out at the Intertoto level so which match were you watching?
30-3-2006|f|I SURELY KNOW ONE THING MAN-U 3 NEWCASTLE 0.
31-3-2006||man u won by 2-0 (not 3-0) against newcastle two weeks ago. and it's premier league.  and it's gonna be 2-0 win again for MU when playing arsenal and chelski.
17-4-2005|m|It came to me as a surprise to hear that Government has baned most of the drugs we can afford to buy, mostly for the treatment of malaria and other problems. But my fear is, will the local companies be able produce the drugs in enough quantities for our need?
21-4-2005|m|Solo2, thanks for pointing this out.  The banned drugs are: - Paracetamol tablets and syrups. - Cotrimoxazole tablets and syrups. - Metronidazole tablets and syrups. - Sulphadoxine Pyrimethamine tablets - Chloroquine tablets and syrups - Heamatinic tablets (such as ferrous sulphate and ferrous gluconate and folic acid tablets) - Vitamin B complex tablets (except modified release formulations) - Multivitamin Tablets, capsules and syrups (except special formulations) - Aspirin tablets (except modified release formulations and soluble aspirin) - Magnesium Trisilicate tablets and suspensions. - Piperazine tablets and syrups. - Levamisole tablets and syrups. - Clotrimazole cream - Ampicillin/Cloxacillin combinations. - Ointment-penicilin/gentamycin - Intravenous Fluid (dextrose, normal saline) - Pyrantel Pamoate tablets and syrups - Disinfectants and Germicides.  So should these drugs have been banned? please invite doctors and pharmacists to the forum so they can give us more informed opinion!
23-4-2005|m|hi, it's me again  Just wondering if there are any links to newspaper sites etc that can confirm these bannings, as they include many products i would bring from australia for things like maleria prevention and head ache treatment etc.  Though they didn't even look in my bag that had my medicines in it at lagos when i was there 3 weeks ago
23-4-2005|m|I copied the above list verbatim from the first page of this week's Sunday Guardian. I couldn't get a link on the web.
25-4-2005|m|In real case it is the importation of these drugs that was banned, but I still insist that our local drug manufacturing companies will not be able to meet up with the demand locally.
12-8-2005|f|omg that is bad . nigerian's can't even produce very effective medication (minus the herbs)
12-8-2005|f|This is extremely sad. I was happy that NIgerians have medicines to cure malaria..and here they are, banning chloroquine!!!
22-8-2005|m|Seun, What was the govt's excuse for such an action.I guess they banned the importation,not use of the drugs!Angel,Chloroquine is no longer effective for malaria(caused by P.Falciparium),common in Nigeria, and most of Africa.New drugs,very expensive has been introduced-Combination of Fansidar and Artesunate. Most of the drugs on the list are important for everyday medical practice,but could be readily produced in Nigeria(govt thnking I believe).Banning them is an attempt to encourage local production.But will this work?! It would only lead to them being more expensive,and open the way for fake drugs-unless adequate measures are taken. Seun,you may have to give us an update of what the drug companies are saying about this!If they can produce HIV drugs,then these should not be a problem!
22-8-2005|m|Don't mind our govt. I still prescribe most of these drugs as there's nothing wrong with them per se.  If you want to ban these drugs then provide alternatives to getting this drugs for common men's affordable.  Our govt. is myopic and does not have interst in poor men.  What a pity.
19-4-2005|f|Phone Etiquette ...  Hi all,  Just wondering what our phone etiquettes (the conduct or procedure required by good breeding or prescribed by authority to be observed in social or official life) really are.  When your phone rings with a call either from a registered or unregistered number, how do you go?
19-4-2005|f|Well, whenever I receive a call from an unregistered number, sometimes I say "hello" and other times "hello, good morning/afternoon/evening". And most recently, because of my job description in which I offer support to clients, I almost include my company's name!  If it is a call from a registered number, I don't think he/she needs such formality. I just go ahead and either say [I]hi[/I], [I]'sup[/I], or call the person's name. Or what do you think?
19-4-2005|f|Well I think the only time one should be formal is when he/she is recieving a call from an official line. I am not formal on my mobile line, just a "hello" or the caller's name if I see it flashing on my set as it rings, though due to the nature of my work, I talk to clients a lot on official line, and because of that, once or twice I have made a mistake of picking a personal call on my mobile as an official call, with all the introductions, can you imagine? I laughed at myself that day.
19-4-2005||Hey, I believe we discussed abit about this on mobilenigeria. Check out:   Anyway, I'm always polite when answering my calls. You know, the usual "hello" stuff.  At times I go a little crazy and shout out "waz uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuup" like in the scary movie film.  If the number's not in my phonebook at times I'm all Hip Hop and go "who this?"  What more can I say?
19-4-2005|f|Trae, that was "Telecrastination" which I believe is somewhat differerent from "phone etiquette"  There is something so common these days especially with the female folk, some guys do it too. What I mean is people trying to speak [I]phonetics[/I], what you hear them say is "hello" pronounced as 'hella' repeatedly.
19-4-2005|f|Whenever my phone rings and the caller is a known person, I mention his or her name in addition to my hello. If it is an unknown caller, I am always like, hello, sorry who is this?
20-4-2005|f|I should think it really depends on who the caller is actually and the level of familiarity between us. Some callers don't even get 'hello' from me. Most times I simply go, 'hey, what's up?' to my friends or 'Monkey, na now you just dey call' or 'hello darling' deservedly reserved for my darling , you know, ..... it depends.  For people who withold caller's ID, I simply go, 'hello, who is this please?'.
25-4-2005|m|Hm... I guess it is no hard fast rule to this. I used to mention my name whenever I am answering a call from unknown number but I had to stop that 'cos of some funny things happening around. I mean some people who just got your number somehow and will like to get your details. So, I believe that it is really not a problem if you answer the call coming from an unknown number with a question requesting to know the identity of the person calling.
25-4-2005|m|If you call me and I don't know who you are, I just say "Hello" in a rather musical voice and wait for you to talk.
17-5-2005|m|I Picked up my call and simply say hello, if it is unknown, but in case of a stored number, I will call your name straight and started gisting. I believe in respect a lot.
17-5-2005|m|Whenever I receive calls 4m unregistered number i simply say Hello good morning, afternoon or evening depending on the time. and if the call is 4m a registered number and the caller is older than me i still greet the caller as above + sir or ma. But if a friend i will just say Y"hello my guy or my babe and conversation begins. Great Peter
25-7-2005|f|when u pick up the phone from an unknown caller what i feel u should say is hello, Good Morning/afternoon/evening My Name is .............. who is on the line pls or who am i speaking with u may never know it could ur boss from headoffice of an employer u just sent ur resume to
12-9-2005||If I get a call from an unknown number, I just say "hello good afternoon" or "hello! bongay..." so the caller can quickly know who's picked the call. But if it is from a registered number, I just say "hey guy", "hey man", "sup baby girl" "dearie" for a girl who's deserved that. Just as simple as that. What do you think?
14-9-2005|f|When my phone rings.. I know who's calling by the ringtones.  My dad's ringtone is mariah carey's "shake it off". I know it's my dad when shake it off is singing, i pick it by saying "hi daddy".  When my friends (girls) call it rings Fat joe's "get popping", so when that sings, i just pick the phone and say "hey biatch".. or "wat's up"... or maybe if it's my nigerian friends i say "kila tun ri gbo ooo"  When my friends (guys) call, it rings Bow wow's "like you". So when that sings i am like, "yo", "wats up", "hi sweet thing", or something masculine like "dude, wat's up".  When a private number is calling me, it sings Missy's "lose control". So i am like "hello, who's this?".  I dont normally check my caller ID. Just hear the ringtone and greet, after greeting.. you know who's there!
14-9-2005|m|"Gossips of the same feather rant together"  I store the names with a voice message so once it rings all i hear if the caller's name twice then my lovely tune - Backstreet boys "Quit playing games" starts. How i respond depends now depends on who's callin. Most times its "wazup Bleep?" (friends and family)  If its an unknown caller. It just rings (no names) and i'm go like- "Hello" . Nothing else until the caller talks.
14-9-2005|f|Amen!
18-9-2005|f|It depends on who calls me. i've got every person that i know, male/female's number on my cell, so most of d time, i know who's callin me. so if it's momsie, it's basically hi mom, if it's a friend, it could b n e thing from waz happening to ''i'm listening'',''talk to me'' etc. Most tymes, when i dunno who's callin(say it's a prof), i just say hi, who's speakin pls.
18-9-2005|f|i think HA said mine..different tones for different people  when its my best friends (girl)..i go "heyyyyyyy" in a loud crazy voice when its a boi..Demi here if its my mum "i use somming really wierd and she says de same bk to me"..we r like girlfriendz if its my dad i say.."Sam" brother or sister ..wats up..kilo sele unknown person..hello whos this..do i know u
19-9-2005|m|Demi..methinks that aint too good..
19-9-2005|f|When i get a call from an unknown number, i pick it up but say nothing immediately. Rather i listen to the voice too determine if i can recognize the voice. If i do, and it's someone i am avoiding i simply cut the call off  but if i don't recognize the voice, i will simply use a sexy, bedroom voice 'hello' please whose on the line?
19-9-2005|f|layi..i dont say it in rude voice and i dont say them all at once lol..  helo..hey dis is... where u gat my number from..i gat it from...
19-9-2005||When my phone.....if its a person know cool, I either say "Hey wassup" or hail the person n a manner pecular to us ....if its a number dont know, say hello n a very cautious guarded way....!!
20-9-2005|f|if my phone rings i just picked it up and say:  Hello aisha speaking,that is if its an unknown number,but if my Bro or sis calls me if just pick it up and YO! My friends i go[b] wassup,or whats cracking[/b].If it my mum i go Yes mum and hummmmm if its him i go Hey babe in a sweet sexy voice
21-9-2005|m|I dont really have a format of answering calls but i guess because i'm used to taking more of personal calls it has my attitude on the fone during official calls tend to be inclined/tilted towards the way i answer personal calls...ciao[b][/b]
21-9-2005|m|i'm not really worried if it's a number i'm conversant with. i ain't hurt anyone so i see no reason y i should be paranoid wen a strange number calls.[b][/b]
22-9-2005|f|Come on! you mean you have not hurt anyone before? No heart breaks?
13-11-2005|f|when i pick up the phone the first thing i say is "hey" or hey whaddupp
19-1-2006||ok. when my phone rings....  my close friend(girl)..... "hey sweetie, whats up?"  My close friend(boy)...... " yo, whats up? how u dey?"  Mum....... "Hello ma,"  Brother........ " hey"  Unknown....... "Hello, whos this?"
01-7-2008|m|Simply and short dont shout
01-7-2008|m|I guess we shud be seeing of this informative threads and posts instead of d 'free browsing' poo which is now d norm.The phone section is gradually losing its value with threads being created at a whim and some clowns like s**k,f**i,s**y and others turning every thread into a chatroom.A return to the good old phone section days is of great necessity.
01-7-2008|m|@ Just2nice  You mean no more Mtn Rocks! ?
01-7-2008|m|When my phone rings, this is how I answer;  1. My Girlfriend; Hello love, Hi hun, sweetheart how r u?? Wats up honey??  2. Hoodrats; Hey babe, O girl how fa??  3. My Hommies; Wither, wetin dey, oboy how fa?? Which levels??  4. My dad; hey pops  5. My mum; Hi ma  6. My siblings; Yes?? What is it??  7. Unknown Caller; Hello, whos speaking please? Na who be this?? Onye na ekwu?? Ibu onye?? Ogini (Depending on my mood)
19-4-2005|m|I guess since this section is about games, we should talk about console and pc games. y top 10 games(not necessarily in that order) of all time are: 1. Mortal Kombat series 2.Tekken Series 3. streetfighter series 4. SOCOM I and II (US Navy Seals) 5. Onimusha 1,2,3 6. The Scorpion king 7. Age OF Empires Series 8. Hitman 1,2, Contract 9. Commandos (BEL) 10. Shenmue (Microsoft Xbox version)  almost all are on Playstation 2. well those are mine. lets read yours
19-4-2005|m|I assume you haven't used an X-Box before. 'Halo' is definitely the best video game of all time! The only video game better than 'Halo' is 'Halo 2', but I've not played that one yet. I have a 'Halo 2' trailer that is just too sweet. I'll post some screenshots when I have the chance.  For ladies, the best Video game is probably 'Sims 2'. Most of us guys will rather be blasting away at aliens than babysitting computer characters, though.
19-4-2005||for me winning eleven soccer on play station or play station 1 is my top pick. it's the computer game i play 99% of the time.  there was a time though when i used to play mortal kombat and street fighter. now i own a playstation 1 but i'm non chalant about playing any game if it ain't soccer.
21-4-2005|m|Seun, you are talking to a reformed game addict. The only console I haven't touched is the nintendo console ("dolphin" or whatever they call it.). Halo? Well, I admit it's real good. But try 'Deus Ex: Invisible War' on PS2 and compare, or 'Devil May Cry' on Xbox.
23-4-2005|m|System Shock 2 Battlefield 1942 Civilization 3 Doom 1 and 2 (3 was a let down, I have it on both PC and Xbox) Commander Keen 4 Half-Life 2 Call of duty No-one lives forever 2  And some more I can't remember  If anyone is interested in playing some xbox live with me, let me know
23-4-2005|m|Related to the Internet-speed-in-Nigeria issue:  I would love to fry you in a game of Halo 2 or Half-Life on Xbox live(), but I doubt that is is possible to enjoy real-time gameplay over a VSAT link. Almost every Iternet connection in Nigeria eventually goes through VSAT. VSAT ping times fall between 0.55s and 1.2s! I don't think it's likely that anyone in Nigeria uses Xbox Live
23-4-2005|m|That is a shame, though if you can put up with poor latency I beleive it's possible to use a router or pc running a distro of linux to share an internet connection to the xbox so it thinks it has broadband and lets you play (this would probably be suitable for the slower paced games)
03-5-2005|m|i dont believe nobody included "Final Fantasy 7, 8, 9 or even X" among their top ten. damn!  my top ten in no particular order:  SF2 turbo Unreal Tournament 2k3 Final Fantasy 7 Zelda 3: A link to the past Crash Team Racing Sypthon Filter 2 Winning Eleven (series) Star Fox

01-6-2005|m|emm, how come nobody mentione Half Life1 & 2?
01-6-2005|m|because they're not people's all time favourites System Shock 2 came out around the same time and I enjoyed it far more than HL1 and HL2 was a dissapoint and with all that messing around with steam  Final Fantasy 7 was the best in the series as well I though, and I just thought of another game I really like No-One-lives-forever 1 and 2.  i'll think up some more later
10-6-2005|m|What's really good ,I just registered today ,seems like fun. Anyway someone wrote that Devil may cry is on XBOX ,that dude needs to get his gaming mind in check cos' Devil may cry is strictly for Playstation ,at least for now . Halo 2 is tight so y'all need to get that. XBOX is about to change the world with 360 ,saw the E3 convention on G4 network and Doom is gonna look mad nice .
10-6-2005|m|Halo rules!!!  Halo 2 rules as well but did not like the ending of Halo 2 compared to the ending of Halo.  I also like Fight for NY on the XBox!

12-8-2005|m|I know I am late to post here (sorry I just noticed this thread)!  How can you guys be gushing on about consoles when there are PC games? Just love-vendor up your PC well, and you have the ultimate console with you...  As for my favourite game, I used to be hooked on MK, Tekken, FIFA 99 (the best FIFA game of all time IMO), KI Gold, Road Rash, Need for Speed, Age of Empires (never saw a better network game) and Civilization. But ever since I first touched the Championship Manager Series (now FM 2005),  I have pretty much ignored everything else, except as a spectator.  As a spectator, some really good games making the rounds now include: Medal of Honor: Allied Assault Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne Deus EX Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Spiderman: The Vampire Armand Unreal Tournament Half Life (all this knowledge comes from hanging out with Texazzpete (seulement un)  but the best head and shoulders above any remains Football Manager 2005!
12-8-2005|m|Trust me, console games are much better than PC games!
12-8-2005|f|Sims 2 All The Way baby. I like sims 2. And even sims 1.
12-8-2005|f|1. Halo 1 & 2 2. Tekken 3. Mortal combat 4. Desperado 5. Fable 6. tennis 7. Sims 1& 2 8. Tomb raider 9. FIFA 2005/2004 10. Base ball  what i play r console games on Xbox,ps2,game boy and Nitendo.No computer games!
13-8-2005|m|Young man, I HAVE TRIED BOTH. Now let us look at the physics: for console games (take XBox as an example (not the new generation XBox), has system specs of 700MHz, 128Mb RAM, 5 Gb HDD, 64 Mb VGA, and all of this computing power is geared towards just running games, unlike in your normal PC where first and foremost a lot of the RAM is already allocated to running the OS.  Now to really enjoy a PC game, my advice is this: love-vendor up your system (2.8GHz, 512Mb RAM, 64Mb VGA as an example), then install GameGain for example. Then let's see what happens...
19-4-2005|m|your first date.  scary topic . Well, tell us about your first date. Was he/she cool or boring? Well in my own case, I was the boring one. We spent minutes in silence thinking of what to say next. I immediately got fed up with the dating game. Lets just say it was a fiasco.
19-4-2005|m|date: 1. An engagement to go out socially with another person, often out of romantic interest. 2. [I]One's companion on such an outing.[/I]  Kodewrita, I think you need a date doctor! How can a healthy young african man talk about being fed up with the dating game?
19-4-2005||Man, I can't really remember how my first date was, or who it was with. But I sure can remember the first girl I talked to ... you know, tried to woo. It was in '99 and she was Ugandan (I was in Uganda at the time) and older than me. But it went really well and we became pen pals ... and later cyber pals. We've lost contact now though.
19-4-2005|f|First date? Yet to be experienced.
19-4-2005|m|Tayotina: Huh?  You were accusing me of being inexperienced when it comes to dating and here you are saying you have not experinced your first date!
19-4-2005|f|Come on Seun, the fact that I have not yet experienced my first date does not mean I don't know anything about dating.  The fact is I really don't attach much importance to it. I go out a lot with my guyz but you know, those candle-lit dinners, scented rose, on bended knees, look into my eyes whatever, whatever ...., those things do not trip me. You know at times when you are at it, tension starts mounting and you start sweating and then you see some guyz messing up. See, you can take me out but not necessarily to a quite place. Take me somewhere I can enjoy myself to the max.
19-4-2005|m|In other words, you have had your first date. Perhaps your dates haven't been impressive, but a date is a date whether you enjoy it or not.  Or am I missing something?
19-4-2005|f|Seun, I know myself better than any other person. I go out with my guyz a lot is different from I go out with my boyfriend ok? If you should ask me anytime, anyday how I felt on my first date? My answer will still remain "yet to be experienced"
20-4-2005|f|I think I understand what tayotina is trying to say. Some of us crave those embellishments, while to others it's unnecessary waste. But really, a date is not about going to the Burj Al Arab (the only 7 star and most expensive hotel in the world) or whatever, even if all he did was take you to Buka, a date is a date is a date...  Now, my first date, properly so called, was as recent as last year actually. And it was simply bliss. All that I dreamed it would be and I dream a lot, mind, so I don't say that lightly.  I had the most pamperedly nice time. So much so that all previous dates faded into insignificance, sorry.
21-4-2005|m|Women. Today they love you. Tommorrow they 'realise' that they have never really loved you, so sorry the relationship is off and there's a new guy ...  So to answer kodewrita's question. I was probably my first date's 999th date. And she probably didn't consider it a date, or maybe she did but won't tell me, who knows?  Women!
21-4-2005|m|Seun, I haven't given up on the dating game. I have only decided to stop following rules. As to a date doctor (that sounds familiar, hmmm, where did I hear that? 'Hitch' the movie. you've been watching too much TV).  I definitely agree dates can be stressful because of all the attached stuff (candles, nice dishes and if you are lucky a restaurant with love cubicles). Mind you, I believe both of you should know it's a date so sorry but maybe your first date wasn't a date (oops I said it).
21-4-2005|f|Dear Admin.,  Don't let's even go there! If a woman loves you today and falls out of love with you tomorrow, not being a mad woman and all, is it not worth pondering over if maybe some crucial thing changed in you or worse still that you never had that 'thing' but simply pretended to be who you weren't just to get her undivided attention? It's been known to happen, you know? At least a ZILLION times.  MEN!!!
21-4-2005|m|Ra, it is a well known fact that men lie and pretend a lot when trying to woo women. the fact that women keep falling for it means maybe they have fundamental issues!  But the fact remains that the average woman would not accept the average man for just being himself. The average guy knows that he can improve his chances by wooing you with behaviours that are not really part of who he is! Like maybe helping you with housework  Women demand to be lied to and that is what they get! Oops, we're supposed to be talking about our first dates ...
22-4-2005|f|Seun that is where you are wrong. I can not stand a guy who is not himself. And I would tell you right there and then that if you want to be with me or go out with me you have got to be like yourself. I can not stand dishonesty or trying to put up a show or fronting and all that because I will know when your are trying so hard to impress.  As for me, I like a guy who is also a friend. I mean we have fun together nothing so uptight or those uncomfortable moments. I like people to feel comfortable around me and I also encourage that. That is why I am open to any discussion and also the topics that I bring up kind of shock people because they want to talk about it but they just do not know how to go about it so I just help them out after all we are all adults.  Well my idea of a date, I do not want all those fancy places because I for one am an active person and sitting still for a longtime will just bore the hell out of me. I love to dance so our date could be, we drive thrrough a fast food restaurant and then we go clubbing or just to do something fun!!! like bowling or just any thing. I mean ok once in a while it would be good to go for a romantic dinner and all that. One thing all these fancy stuff do not really matter to me.  I mean simple good stuff make me feel good so I think that whoever I am going to date would be very lucky because I do not even like people paying for me so we would probably share the bills. Like I said he would also be a friend as well as a boyfriend so he would feel that awkward about us sharing the bills but I guess once in a while I will just let him pay to satisfy his male ego ...  It is all about the honesty. If you have anything to say to me better say it to my face. One thing iis that I ask questions that people are thrown off but that is just me. I mean, I am not rude or anything like that. It is just that they feel uncomfortable mentioning those so I just help them out.  When I go on a date I take it as hanging out I mean it is a mind set that I take up so that it does not seem that awkward but just that it is a little bit more than just hanging out at the same time ...
22-4-2005||I will only go so far with Seun about the facts of life. There will always be the exception or exceptions to the rule. funny enough, there are exceptions within those exceptions@!! lol  One point though is:[list]  [li]The typical woman will say to the man: "I have never felt anything like this in my former relationship(s) ..." Seun, I wonder along with you what she told the previous dude![/li]  [li]The typical dude tells the chic, "I will always love you". Once the word "yes" comes forth, tolerance and the patience levels slump like microsoft shares!![/li][/list]  Let's get back to the point. My first date was friend rice and chicken no doubt at a cosy place. (I cant really remember details of most "first" times) But I must have given myself a pat on the back for being the stand up guy afterwards. I am waiting for 7 star hotels, and very private settings for two. Maybe I will come by againt to post about my "new first" ever date.  A word to Tayotina though: the way you described that romantic date in your first post hints that you are still waiting for that dream to come true. Try me! My number is 080 ...
22-4-2005|m|Femi, Femi, Femi, how many times did I call you?  It seems you are trying to toast all the chicks in Nairaland or you are trying to tell us the meaning of your name ...  First with Trish and now Tayotina ...  [I]I comment my reserve[/I]  By the way, never had a date ...
25-4-2005|m|thank God
28-4-2005|m|First dateWell, I was so inexperienced at the time, while my "baby" was sooo experienced, so she sort of virtually took over, except of course paying for things bought.  It was at first quite, but as the evening rolls up, My mouth opens and being chattery herself, we sort of end it up on a good note....although there was no touching, which i guess she wanted.  That eventually stoppedour seeing, So I sort of made it up for the next girl without going too far.  It was generally a sweet one sha
01-6-2005|f|I've always tried to avoid it, but the day it came, because of my inexprience, it was dry (so to say).  That day I think it rained so it was so cold and the AC in that joint was on, so I was shaking. There was nothing to say!  Anyway I enjoyed it, but it wasn't funny.
03-6-2005|f|Well,my first date was too much,the guy was crazy about me and ready to sell his shirt just to buy me anything i want, and something to talk about?? Um!!nobody can ever be bored when you are around me.so i would say... My first date was a SLAM!!!! meaning:a complete success!!
03-6-2005|f|tayotina, wat else could be more romantic than the scene u described above? if u dont attach much importance to it, i will understand, but for the fact that it doesnt trip u.....that i dont understand o!!!
06-6-2005|m|@pinky i agree with u. why anybody won't be impressed by that i don't know. Tv has created the impression that that works. So its a shock that it doesn't work in your case. of course other factors will always affect the issue.
06-6-2005|f|Pinky,  Thank God you are Pinky and I am Tayotina. That means we are two different persons. Really those things do not trip me. Some say I am weird but that is the Tayo in me. Maybe when you get to know me better, you would understand.  Kodewrita,  TV has created the impression that it works, well not for me because some men tend to put up their best behaviour at that moment. So just come out of your shock, ok? Remember, one man's meat is another man's poison!!!!
06-6-2005|f|My first date was the bomb.  The guy and I had a date in a eatery. But on getting there, I met him waiting outside the place. He said he just had a sudden change of heart and we should please go somewhere else. So off we went.  I was shocked to discover he was taking me to a crib (a house) which turned out to be his.  I couldn't be annoyed because, gosh!, when I entered that house, I was dumbfounded at the way he had set the table for us. It was so so romantic. I was managing to hide how impressed I was. We had a candle-lit dinner for two!  After dinner, we listened to cool music. I am an extrovert, so we had so many thinks to talk about. It was getting late. I stood to go home ... because the environment was getting too cosy. I didn't want to regret my actions, so I just had to leave!  He drove me home, and as I got out of the car, I leaned by this window side (a girl's trick if you must know) and he gave me that kiss. Hulalalalal!  It was a perfect date ... I dont want anyone reading my this reply and getting jealous of me, ok?
06-6-2005|m|As if that's not the point of this whole story!  Do you know that, as a guy, I can simply memorize and reproduce this romantic scene with just about any girl without actually feeling anything for her? Do you know that, in fact, it is harder for us to be so 'romantic' when we have genuine feelings vs when we're trying to score or achieve some other objective?
06-6-2005|f|oluwaseun osewa.. point of correction, am not saying i fell for him, neither did i tell u we went into a relationship, i am only answering the question "how was ur first date" so dont tell me about wat u guys feel or not cos i already know that u guys re good at putting up an act most times i never said all he did got into my head, i only made it known that i enjoyed my first date & tripped for the guy's acts shikena!
06-6-2005|m|Noted.
06-6-2005||I wonder if it qualifies, but my first date was in my house. I couldn't go to his party (he was traveling), or be seen with him, so he brought some fast food and a bottle of non alcoholic wine to my place so that we could celebrate. I thought it was sweet, but i was too shy so i just sipped a bit of the wine and my lil bro came back from school and ate the stuff .  Cheesy, i know. But it's still the sweetest thing and the most original thing anyone has every done for me. Thats where one can say it's the thought that really counts .
06-6-2005|f|same here
07-6-2005|m|My first date, boy o boy o boy, it was terrible. It was so bad I'm actually embarassed remembering it. The girl was beautiful, but I was a slacker and she showed it to me that I was one. If you see the way the girl yabbed (scolded) me. 'First gate k , first date ni'

08-6-2005|f|Pinky [I]'your own beta joo'[/i]. Seun, don't be a spoilsport!  My own first date? I was so afraid that the guy was going to ask me to "pay" at a later date that I totally refused to eat anything!
19-4-2005|m|Hello,  My name's Seun and I'm a Star Wars fan. I think it's one of the greatest movie series of all time. Some people who are fans of the older versions IV, V, and VI think that I and II were not too good. But I don't think so. I think they are all good!  My favorite character is C3PO (pronounced 'tripio'). I find his talkativeness very amusing. I like R2D2 too. The movie series has so many original concepts. Yoda, an old man who can fight! Light sabres that are more lethal than guns! "The force", which makes Jedis so powerful! The concept of the "dark side". A handsome, talented young man who turns bad!  To explore the Star Wars Universe, you can visit 'Beyond the Movies' on StarWars.com. There's much more to Star wars than the movies.  Now I happen to have a page spoilers for the upcoming Star Wars Episode 3 - 'The Revenge of the Sith'. It includes screenshots and the full story line. If enough Star Wars 3 fans on the forum indicate interest, I will provide a way for them to view the page.  So if you're a Star Wars fan, please drop a note here and privately ask me for a copy of the spoilers!  [I]Yes, I know, there are a lot of exclamation marks in this post![/I]
20-5-2005|m|yo! i did not c this. i missed this...well nothing lke a star wars movie.looks like this new starwars has been hyped to the max.i hope it does not disappoint me

22-6-2005|f|Seun, you really shouldn't love star wars. No black dude nor girl love star wars. It for white folks only. I personally have nothing to do with star wars.

27-7-2005|f|STAR WARS ROCKS. I was the number one person to see it in the movies when it came out newly
10-9-2005|m|yeah i've seen star wars.it is da bomb.my favourite character is anakin skywalker.'cos of his attack strategy:offence being the best defence.He is so brutal and merciless.I also like yoda 4 d part he played when fightin with darth sidious.
11-9-2005|m|Goofs for Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith  * Continuity: Anakin's scar on his right eye changes, the part below his eye moves slightly down and lengthens.  * Continuity: During Anakin and Obi Wan's final fight, bodies on the floor appear and disappear between shots.  * Continuity: When Anakin arrives at Mustafar he tells R2-D2 to stay with the ship. As Anakin walks away he puts his hood on. His right hand (his mechanical hand covered by a glove) has somehow turned back into flesh again.  * Audio/visual unsynchronized: During the opera on Coruscant, you can hear the sound of people cheering and clapping, but when the audience is shown, they are all sitting still, hands in their lap.  * Continuity: When Mace Windu gets on the air transport and tells Anakin to stay behind, the shadow of the vehicle disappears in the shot when Anakin is seen alone, but reappears in the next shot when we see the vehicle take off.  * Continuity: During the scene where Padme in her apartment and Anakin at the Jedi temple look out across the city toward each other, the position of the setting sun and the direction of its light across their respective locations is not consistent given what we are shown about their relative positions and the directions they are facing.  * Continuity: The pearl shoulder straps of Padme's dress disentangle between shots.  * Incorrectly regarded as goofs: The button Padme pushes to start her ship near the end of the film is the same "magic" button that has two functions in "Attack Of The Clones". It's shot in exactly the same way and is a deliberate joke.  * Continuity: In the final sequence on Tatooine, when Obi Wan is handing the infant Luke to Beru, he opens his cloak to bring the baby out as he approaches her. This is first seen in a long shot from above. There is a cut to a two-shot, and he opens his cloak and extracts the baby again.  * Continuity: When Anakin is choking Obi-Wan, Obi-Wan is holding his own lightsaber, then it cuts and he's holding Anakin's lightsaber.  * Continuity: During the scene when Yoda enters a room to confront Darth Sidious and knocks the two guards unconscious using the force, the position of the guard's bodies shift during their fight scene and are positioned (conspicuously conveniently) out of the way.  * Revealing mistakes: When Sidious is knocked back by Yoda in his office, the stunt double's hand is visible. Sidious's hands are old, wrinkly, and his nails are dark. But this hand is perfectly healthy and much larger.  * Continuity: After Anakin has choked Padme she falls to the ground and her right arm falls out in front of her but in the close-up, her arm is resting across her stomach.

14-4-2005|f|Uumm..... but for geographical constraint, I would have been tempted .......
20-4-2005||anyone know the link to the gulder ultimate search show? understand registration ends today
20-4-2005|f|pieta, seems you skipped that
20-4-2005|m|Actually, he posted it on a new topic which I had to merge with this one.
23-4-2005|f|Ok. I visited the site last nite with a friend who registered and there i saw registration was to end same day (yesterday).
25-4-2005|f|I don't understand why both sexes should partake in this competition. Shouldn't they have organised separate competitions, one for females only and the other for males?  This is a test of physical fitness, and similar competitions like athletics( running, football and even swimming, both sexes have never been made to compete against eachother. The organisers should have a rethink, only then will I partake .
25-4-2005|f|trish, i felt same way with you when it was first aired. why in the world should a man and a woman be subjected to same competition especially since it is to do with physical fitness? all the same i was happy some guys dropped out before the ladies .
25-4-2005|m|Trish, you're very right. I think the current set-up is unfair to women. Personally, I think such programmes are a little bit degrading to the competitors, both men and women! I hate the way the presenter talks down to them as if the show is something important.  Give me a break, it's just an elaborate advertisement for Gulder!
25-4-2005|m|bah I like star better anyways (actually now I think about it, they all kinda taste the same after you've had a few )
25-4-2005|m|Hunter, we are not comparing shacks here. BTW, I think star is better sha!
28-4-2005||pls how can i register 4 the gulder ultimate search?
28-4-2005|m|Maurice, registration is over. They are now screening potential contestants:   Sorry.
02-5-2005||I agree, the show is an elaborate advert for Gulder, and maybe it doesn't seem fair to pitch men against women. But it is based on the survivor series and this is what happens on those shows. As someone noted, last year some men went out before the girls so it isnt completely about brawn. Also, the show is meant for entertainment it's not some great sporting feat and it would be boring to have a show with only guys or gals.  The last girl standing will likely get something additional (I hear Governor Duke promised 1 million). The company wants to sell it's products but in selling it is contributing to the lives of the participants in a way they wouldn't have had otherwise, so I think its a win-win. Also I know a lot of people go in for shows like this not for the prize but for the visibility so its not about winning but making sure you get noticed.  In all, I think the company is doing a good thing. Selfish motives are what business is all about and there are ways to sell your product without contributing to peoples lives. I hate reality shows and don't actually follow any but my theory is every man to his own poison and if this works for some then they should enjoy.
04-5-2005|f|Hey guys, Ten contestants made up of six men and four women have emerged for the competition scheduled to take place between May 14 and June 4. AIT, STV, NTA and African magic channel on DSTV are expected to broadcast the reality show.  I didn't enjoy the first show, as a matter of fact, I call it "bush brother Nigeria" , hope this is not a part 2.
07-5-2005|m|badwils, the only 'problem' I have with the show is last year's presenter! I feel that he acted too serious, behaving like some authority figure. That deep voice, that smirk, and utterances like "so you think you have what it takes to [I]become[/I] the Ultimate Champion, we'll see. Or the words that are spoken when some contestants are booted, as if the person failed a cosmic quest.  UPDATE: Chidi Mokeme, the presenter, is back this year.  See also: Gulder Ultimate Search 2: Meet the Contestants!
17-5-2005|f|Do you know guys that the show has kicked off? It was a red carpet reception for the contestants, even Donald Duke was there to receive them.  By the way, the Obudu ranch,very inviting! You could touch the clouds
17-5-2005|m|I caught the end of the show yesterday. Apparently, someone won 500,000 naira in one of their promos ("buy a bottle of Gulder, check under the crown-top, ..."  Will this program succeed in getting people who don't drink to buy Gulder? Would it convince people who drink Gulder already to drink more often? If the answer to any of the above questions is "yes", is this a good thing?
17-5-2005|m|Trish, you can't touch clouds so I know that's just an expression  I guess you have heard about the leopards that are stalking them and a species of snake called "no tommorrow" that permanently resides there. I guess that is not enough to deter anyone from making money by risking their lives.  They also have to airlift you if you are mauled by animals when anybody knows bad weather can prevent the copters from reaching you.
17-5-2005|f|Hi. I would like to meet the presenter one on one. I mean Chidi Mokeme. How do I go about it? Please get in touch with me.
18-5-2005|f|Why would you want to meet with Chidi?  I don't know whether I like the way he presents or not. He got my mum so pissed off in the last search that she'd rather watch past versions of reality shows on DSTV than watch Chidi with the way he languidly drawls on the names of the contestants without the proper pronunciation.  And his accents! Is he not an ibo guy? Where he gets the pronunciation of the non-ibos wrong, he doesn't do better with the Ibo names. Please listen to him!
19-5-2005|f|What's up?  The show is really becoming interesting, but I think the participants are really too dull for my liking. Agreed it's not easy but they are really not helping matters at all. Chidi is really nice this time around because he's really taking his time to give clues to the participants on how they shuld go about the game.yesterdays show was really very technical.  I mean why should a girl cry as if she was forced out of her house? It's not a do or die affair. But if u shuld ask me I think she should be asked to go back home or what do you think?
19-5-2005|f|I love the concept of the show, but there are too many goofs i.e. the presenter Chidi. I can stand him in films because there would be other actors who'll probably overshadow his voice but this. I mean, the monotonic wisecracks, for Pete's sake couldn't they have gotten another person for the job?  As for the searchers, they are ok, but most times boring. There's no serious competition between them yet, just silly fights and all. My presonal favorites are Martin, Chichi, Sam and Lucan.
19-5-2005||I couldn't agree more with you, Coke. I think Chidi Mokeme's presenting skills make me wanna gag . He acts like he's in charge and calling all the shots (which unfortunately he is!) He seems to have taken a shine to Vaughan, just like he did to Julian in the first show. Maybe his badluck will rub of on Vaughan aka 'the General', and he'll lose out too. It's suddenly looking a lot better now!!
20-5-2005|m|Gulder Ultimate Search, eghmmmmmmm this episode seems very interesting eghmmmmm ill just keep watching and the 500Gs being won eghmmmmm, ill just keep watching
20-5-2005|f|I think the competition is begining to take its toll on the contestants. Guys, please give Chidi Mokeme a break. Unfortunately he's the presenter and that's final. He's going to be paid for the job he's doing. If you ask me, I think he's tryin anyway. The contestants should get serious, that's all.
20-5-2005|f|I believe this site is the administor's: Seun.  I'll like to know what the benefits are. I mean are we just here to be drooling after the searchers, when some guys are busy making money for themselves?  I'm new here and not very good at manouevering the site. Just a quick question: do you know whether there's any other reality TV show coming up in Nigeria, and (emnnnn) most especially DSTV Project Fame or Big Brother? Tired of watching this search thing that's 1hr reality ...  Overally seun, I know you are doing a very good job, you know you can take this up for our show industry?  rgds,  julea
21-5-2005|m|The governor of Cross-Rivers state is giving the last woman standing an extra N1 million , talk about discrimination!
21-5-2005|m|You know as well as I know that the women are not likely to win this competition.
23-5-2005|f|Haba Seun, I don't quite agree with you, you know. What a man can do a woman can do better. Have you forgotten that adage so soon? But come to think of it, these set of women are all weaklings. Or what do you think? Agreed, I am a female but they are really not competing with the men at all. I guess they need somebody to tell them that they are out for adventure and not for cruising o.
23-5-2005|m|The Governor intends to give 1 million to the last woman standing regardless of her position.

I invite all lovers of peace and unity to join in felicitating all our muslim brethren as they celebrate the birth of Prophet Mohammed.
17-6-2005|m|Easter, Hajj, and Spiritual Awakening  Easter and Hajj are perhaps the most important festivals of Christianity and Islam respectively - two world religions that have so much in common in their essence but which are at loggerheads in so many parts of the world. The focus of both religions has been on organizations, which provide material benefits and earthly influence for their leaders and close associates. Their common core has become veiled as the emphasis has shifted from individual search for truth and individual relationship with the Creator. Easter is preceded by the Holy Week, the last week of Lent, a 40-day penitential period of prayer and fasting (which reminds one of the Muslim Ramadan). The Friday before Easter is the so-called Good Friday, commemorating the death on the Cross-of Jesus Christ, while Easter celebrates Christs resurrection. Easter is central to the whole Christian calendar. The dates of all movable Christian feasts (in contrast to festivals like Christmas whose dates are fixed) are based on the date of Easter. Moreover, the whole liturgical calendar of worship (the dates for observing various Church rituals) is arranged around the date of Easter. There are two major celebrations in Islam. The first marks the completion of Ramadan, the month during which Muslims fast daily from dawn to sunset as part of an effort towards self-purification and betterment. This celebration is known as Eid ul-Fitr. The second major Islamic celebration takes place during the time of the Hajj, or annual pilgrimage to Mecca. The Hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam, and thus an essential part of Muslim faith and practice. Although only the pilgrims in Mecca can participate fully in the Hajj, all other Muslims in the world join with them by celebrating the Eid ul-Adha or Festival of Sacrifice.  Many countries of the world (especially the developing countries) have never had so many churches and so many mosques have never known a greater intensity of religious activities and zeal. And yet in these same countries we witness so much hatred and distrust among religious individuals and a dogged resistance against peaceful and just solutions to the multifarious national and global problems. Those who are most flagrantly unjust and corrupt and those who grossly abuse public office are to be found in the ranks of the self-proclaimed staunchest religious champions. What can be the explanation? Is it possible that these religions no longer have the power to make us good human beings? Is it the case that we do not really understand the teachings brought by Jesus Christ and Prophet Mohammed (Peace Be Upon Him)? Both teachings came from God, and both are emphatic about justice and love, and respect for human lives and human rights. May it be that we are mere hypocrites and that we have no conviction in these teachings? We do not need to think deeply before we come to the conclusion that Christian and Muslim ideals are patently lacking in the social, economic, and political life of todays world.  The period of Lent leading to Easter is a time for reflection, genuine change, and a genuine striving to live in accordance with the teachings of Jesus. Hajj presents the same opportunities with respect to the teachings of Prophet Mohammed. Let us be reminded that both Easter and the Hajj are about spiritual awakening, about inner change, about being truly born again. Parenthetically, I should note that there is widespread misunderstanding and debasement of the spiritual concept of being born again. The Hajj is meant to be an opportunity to seek forgiveness of sins accumulated throughout ones life. Prophet Mohammed is reported to have said that a person who performs Hajj properly will return as a newly born baby, determined not to sin again, and resolved to forgive the sins others may have committed against him or her. The pilgrimage also enables Moslems of different races, ethnic groups, and languages from all over the world to come together in a spirit of universal brotherhood and sisterhood. The Hajj is not a religious jamboree but a deeply spiritual event. The rites of the Hajj include going around the Ka'bah seven times and going seven times between the hills of Safa and Marwa. In the knowledge that the number seven signifies spirit, one can say that the rites testify to the deep spiritual nature of Hajj. Whoever does not celebrate it in spirit gains nothing.  The term Easter was first used when Christianity was introduced to the Saxons. Before this time, the Saxons had held an annual feast in honor of the ancient Teutonic goddess of Spring called Eostre. The name was transferred to the Christian observance of Jesus Christs resurrection. Spring is the season that marks the awakening of nature following the slumber or death during the Winter months. In the Tropics, which unlike the Temperate Zone, has only two seasons (wet and dry) this death and resurrection of nature is not as dramatic as it is in the Temperate Zone. But the phenomenon does exist. In the dry season, grasses die, some trees shed their leaves, and the activities of some species of animals are curtailed, similar to the conditions of Winter. At the start of the rainy season, there is a new growth of grasses and leaves and a revitalization of animal activities, reminiscent of Spring.  Easter has always been closely linked with Spring, the season of the awakening or the resurrection of nature. In the early years of Christianity, Jewish Christians observed the resurrection and Passover together on the 14th day of Nisan, the Jewish month roughly corresponding with April. However, Gentile Christians celebrated the resurrection every Sunday with a special emphasis on the Sunday closest to the 14th day of Nisan. To settle this difference, church leaders fixed the date for Easter at the Nicene Council in 325 AD. They decided that Easter would be the first Sunday following the Paschal full moon. The Paschal full moon is the first full moon after the vernal equinox, which occurs on March 21; March 21 marks the official beginning of Spring. The system that was agreed at the Nicene Council for fixing the date of Easter is still followed today. Therefore, Easter Sunday moves between March 22 and April 25. However, the Eastern Orthodox Church follows a slightly different calculation. As a result, the Orthodox Easter, although sometimes coinciding with that of other Christians, can fall one, four, or five weeks later. But it still remains a springtime celebration. It is interesting to note the dependence of the date of Easter on the moon, just like Muslim festivals.  As a celebration of the awakening of nature, Easter should become a festival of spiritual awakening and renewal for all human beings, regardless of religion. We should consider Easter a time for the awakening of the inner self; a resurrection of our individual spirits from spiritual slumbers. It is a time to rededicate ourselves to doing the Will of God so that we who have journeyed as immature spirits into the deep vale of the World of Matter may one day be able to ascend into Paradise, our permanent home. May all peoples, particularly Christian and Muslim political leaders around the world, be imbued with the sense of love, justice, humility, and tolerance that comes with genuine spiritual renewal, which is the essential purpose of both Easter and Hajj. And may such love, justice, humility, and tolerance translates into actions, so that ray of spiritual light may begin to break through the ethereal darkness that envelops the earth. Amen.  Efforts to make the individual countries of the world as well as the global system more loving, more just, and more equitable deserve the support of every true follower of the teachings of Jesus and/or of Prophet Mohammed through concrete deeds and not by mere words. The good news is that, in line with the special spiritual nature of our times, all genuine good volition is supported strongly by invisible, non-physical powers. Therefore, we should not be afraid of the apparent might of human beings and governments that may be bent on perpetuating injustice and evil; they must fail, sooner or later. In the end, the power of the Light will shatter the ethereal darkness hanging over the earth. Spiritual light will shine brightly on us and with the destruction of ethereal darkness and its agents, materialism and religiosity will give way to a genuine desire to learn and to do the true Will of God, which is once again revealed to us at this time of the Cosmic Turning Point in the work entitled In the Light of Truth, The Grail Message by Abd-ru-shin (civil name Oskar Ernst Bernhardt). We would do so as independent individuals who jealously guard our God-given Free Will and who refuse to be mere tools in the hands of leaders of religious and related organizations as well as other manipulators.By Stephen Lampe
14-11-2005||Thank you, Diakim! May the almighty Allah continue to bless you (Amin).  Also, kudos to "Hnd - holder" for sharing with us that insightful write-up. Thanks.
06-2-2012||Can we Celebrate the Birthday of Prophet Muhammad?  There is nothing in the Quraan to say that we should celebrate the Mawlid or birthday of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). The Prophet himself (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not do this or command anyone to do it, either during his lifetime or after his death. Indeed, he told them not to exaggerate about him as the Christians had exaggerated about Jesus (upon whom be peace). He said: Do not exaggerate about me as the Christians exaggerated about the son of Maryam. I am only a slave, so say, The slave of Allaah and His Messenger. (Reported by al-Bukhaari). What has been reported is that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) made the day of his birth a day of worship, which is different to celebration. He was asked about fasting on Mondays, and he said: That is the day on which I was born and the day on which I was entrusted with the Mission or when I was first given Revelation. (Reported by Muslim, al-Nisaai and Abu Dawood).  Moreover, we know that the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) were the people who loved the Prophet most. Was it reported that Abu Bakr, who was the closest of people to him and the one who loved him the most, celebrated the birthday of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)? Was it reported that Umar, who ruled for twelve years, or Uthmaan, did this? Was it reported that Ali, his relative and foster son, did this? Was it reported that any of the Sahaabah did this? No, by Allaah! Is it because they were not aware of its importance, or did they not truly love the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)? No one would say such a thing except one who has gone astray and is leading others astray.  Did any of the imaams  Abu Haneefah, Maalik, al-Shaafii, Ahmad, al-Hasan al-Basri, Ibn Seereen  do this or command others to do it or say that it was good? By Allaah, no! It was not even mentioned during the first and best three centuries. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said in a saheeh hadeeth: The best of mankind are my generation (or my century), then those who come after them, then those who come after them. Then there will come a people who will not care if their testimony comes before their oath or vice versa (i.e., they will not take such matter seriously). (Reported by al-Bukhaari, Muslim and al-Tirmidhi). The celebration of the Prophets birthday appeared many centuries later, when many of the features of true religion had vanished and bidah had become widespread.  Thus this celebration became a sign of ones love for the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)? But can it be possible that the Sahaabah, the imaams and the people of the best three centuries were unaware of it, and it was only those who came later who were aware of its importance?! What the Quraan tells us is that love of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is demonstrated by following the guidance he brought. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):  Say (O Muhammad): If you (really) love Allaah, then follow me, Allah will love you and forgive you your sins. And Allaah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.  Say: Obey Allaah and the Messenger. But if they turn away, then Allaah does not like the disbelievers. [Aal Imraan 3:31-32]  The first aayah explains that love is just a claim, but the proof of sincerity is following what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) brought. The second aayah reaffirms the importance and necessity of obeying Allaah and His Messenger. Hence Allaah ended the aayah with a very stern warning in which those who refuse to obey are described as kaafirs, and Allah does not love the disbelievers. We ask Allaah to keep us safe from that. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told us of the danger of not obeying him, and the danger of adding to what he brought. The celebration of Mawlid or his birthday is indeed an addition to what he brought  as all the scholars agree. He said: The best of speech is the Book of Allaah, and the best of guidance is the guidance of Muhammad. The most evil of things are those which are newly-invented (in religion), and every innovation is a going astray. (Reported by Muslim and al-Nisaai).  We ask Allaah to protect us from bidah and to bless us by helping us to follow. Allaah knows best. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.  The celebration of Al-Mawlid is a reprehensible Bidah and its celebrators have strayed away from the truth, because the religion of Allah is complete and perfect. Allah says that which translates as: "This day I have perfected for you your religion and completed my favour upon you and have approved for you Islam as a religion." (Al-Maaidah: 3).  Imaam Maalik, may Allah have mercy upon him, said: "What was considered at that time (i.e. the time of the Prophet sallAllahu alaihi wa sallam and his companions) as a part of the religion is the religion, otherwise it is not a part of the religion."  It is a historical fact that the Bidah of Al-Mawlid was initiated by Al-Ubaydiyyoon, who were the atheists that ruled the Faatimi state. This Bidah was definitely and undoubtedly not practiced by the distinguished first three generations of the Muslim nation, it is a new innovation and it is misguidance. The Prophet sallAllahu alaihi wa sallam said: "Every Bid'ah (innovation) is misguidance" (Ahmad, Tirmidhi and others). All new innovation are rejected by Allah because the Prophet sallAllahu alaihi wa sallam said: He who does something which is not according to what we (i.e., the Prophet sallAllahu alaihi wa sallam and his companions) are upon then it is rejected (Muslim). Imaam An-Nawawi, may Allah have mercy upon him, said: "Rejected' meaning false and not considered by Allah at all." He also said: "This Hadeeth lays down one of the great fundamentals of Islam, which rejects and refutes any new innovation in Islam." He further said: "This Hadeeth must be spread and used as a means to negate all new evils."  Therefore, the Bidah of Al-Mawlid is misguidance which is rejected and has no significance to the religion of Islam.
21-4-2005|f|No one knows it all really and absolutely no man is an island. I've often wondered what exactly makes, constitutes and maintains a great relationship. Right from the onset; when boy meets girl and likes what he sees and hears, hiss next action is to ask for her number, is this the point where the babe is expected to turn coy and refuse to give him the number?  How do you know when a girl/guy is only having you on?  How do you convey to a suitor that you also like him without appearing too forward or 'cheap'?  Having started the relationship, what are the unlisted dos and donts that sustain it?  If anyone by chance knows the answers to any or all of these questions, please shoot, cause I'm all ears
22-4-2005|m|Well the fact that I have zero experience with relationships won't keep me from sharing my opinion!  [I]How do you know when a guy is only having you on?[/I] He asks you to marry him.  [I]How do you convey to a suitor that you also like him without appearing too forward or 'cheap'?[/I] You mean you can't just tell him  Women!
22-4-2005|f|It's a free world. If I want a man as much as he wants me, I'd let him know. It might not be immediately but somehow, I will find a way of communicating it to him. And I believe any matured man will not see that as being too forward.  In sustaining a relationship, I think the most important part of any healthy relationship between two people is being able to communicate, that is, talk and listen to one another and by so doing, you and your partner can figure out what your common interests are.  Secondly, you must learn to respect and trust each other. Talking calmly when disagreements happen helps you to understand the real reason for not getting along.  You know that you are in a healthy relationship with someone because you feel good about yourself when you are around that person. Unhealthy relationships can make you feel sad, angry, scared, or worried.  Healthy relationships involve an equal amount of give and take in the relationship. In unhealthy relationships, there is an unfair balance. You may feel that most of the time you are giving the other person more attention than they give to you.  I believe when you are in a healthy relationship, you should feel safe around your partner and also feel that you can trust him/her with your secrets.  Well these are what I have learnt from my past relationships and I intend holding on to.
22-4-2005||simple rule: Do you want it to work? Does the partner want it to work? Then do things .. say things.... that will make it work. some people call it: -----------COMMITMENT!----------------
22-4-2005|m|Well, my personal belief is that you should be free to express yourself before whoeever you are dating without the fear of being mocked. If you sense you will not be able to do this, then there is a problem somewhere. On the question of whether a lady can let a guy know she loves him. I don't see anything wrong in that. Some guys don't find it easy expressing themselves. So, it will do the lady and the guy a lot of good if the lady can help the guy out Anyway, let's embrace commitment. That's a strong key to maintaining health relationship. I want us to remember ths story of the chicken and the pig in bacon. The chicken is only involved while the pig is committed. So, let's move into deep commitment. enjoy
22-4-2005|m|I agree with the idea of commitment, but I inisist that if the guy is not engaged to the girl their "commitment" is not to be taken seriously. Such commitment is not real. What you are saying in essence is that 'I reserve the right to dump you if I find someone else who is more suitable'. What sort of commitment is that?
22-4-2005|f|If I may ask what type of engagement are u talking about?
22-4-2005|m|Engagement 3: a mutual promise to marry (syn: betrothal, troth) Source: dictionary.com  The above definition is exactly what I mean by engagement. It means 'I will marry you'. It means 'be my wife'.  (no, not necessarily [I]you[/I] ... )
23-4-2005|f|Interesting debate so far. As I said earlier, no single person knows it all or holds all the answers to matters of the heart. More often than not, we're all better individuals for sharing ideas and learning from people's experiences.  Suffice to say that I've learnt a thing or two so far and I'm certain other people have as well.  As relates to the issue of committment; it takes time to grow you know? In my opinion, committing to a relationship would mean that you both know each other to a very reasonable extent and are ready, knowing what you do about each other, to give your all to the relationship. That is when both parties start talking about getting engaged, either the traditional way by getting the parents to know themselves or the western way by exchanging rings and all.  In any event, I wish everyone what they wish themselves relationship wise. May all looking for it find true love with which dwell happiness, joy and peace of mind together with fulfillment. Did I hear a resounding amen.....?
24-4-2005|m|Amen  So what is this true love?
25-4-2005|f|Let me put it this way, there types of relationships that will never work . what i am trying to say in essense is that for there to be a relationship, there is a reason, a drive so to say, for which a guy would approach a girl to start up one or for which a gurl would agree to start up one.  * fear: fear of rejection or of never getting married or old age. such a lady has no defined values - she does not know who she is, who she wants or why she wants that kind of person.  * guilt: you feel sorry for your partner and feel if you stay with him/her you can help overcome his/her problems. You feel guilty when you try to leave cos there is a strong attachment now. It never works cos when he/she recovers from the problems, you suddenly discover you are no longer needed.  * money: it is a natural instint to seek protection and wellbeing in any relationship as well as to ensure that you are with a man that can be a good provider to you. However, when the size of the wallet becomes the only reason that the relationship exist, it becomes a money driven relationship, and then the money determines how you feel and respond to each other. The lady is enslaved by his money and it is almost impossible to oblige him sex cos when you do, he zips up his bulging wallet!  * if a relationship is sex driven, it is self centerd and selfish. the moment you cease to derive pleasure from the sex, the relationship crumbles. The character of a person cannot be acurately measured by how good or bad they are in bed.  * romance is an essential ingredient in the critical mix of factors responsible for making a relationship work, but when it assumes a mojor role, the relationship becomes lopsided and fails to delvelope as it ought to. such type of relationship often end as soon as the realities of life begin to show up. when romance stops for any reason, true love is absent to support it and so it crumbles. romance should therefore be balanced with genuine love for the relationship to work.
25-4-2005|m|Hm... quite interesting thus far. I will like to shed more light on the issue of commitment. To be committed, it does not necessary mean that both of you have known each other well, but u make up your minds to seek to know and understand each other more. This involves sacrifice and that's why it seems that many are still running away from serious relationship till date. So, as soon as you find who you feel you could spend the rest of your life with, I don't understand why you can't then go ahead to give it all it takes. enjoy
23-6-2005|m|Basically we need to answer these questions objectively..First and formost...there is a word called deception. I may pretend I like you coz all I want is actually sex. And if I don't pretend to like you...NO sex... So in my opinion before you actually are engaged to anyone, all you are simply doing is fooling around..Its for every one to understand himself and know what he/she is most comfortable with in terms of relationships. some girls don't mind casual sex, some think its a great deal. I think it is fun. However when you are ready to settle down, let everyone know, that you aint playing games no more that it is time to raise a family. You don't have to know someone forever before you get married
02-2-2006|f|This is really very interesting, getting to hear the views of the two sexes involved. but one thing i know is that for a relationship to be healthy, then the sex factor must be out because what sex does in a relationship is to cloud your judgement about the person you are involved with. In situations where you are supposed to ask questions and notice things that might not be so right, your mind is busy thinking about what should be left for later. I bet a great deal of self control is needed here for a relationship to be healthy.
22-10-2009|m|Every game has it's rules, so in relationship you must know what to and what not to do for you to get a healthy relationship. Nothing they say goes for nothing. When you do what you ought to do in your relationship you get a pecfect one and the vice versa. To know what you ought and ought not to do to get a healthy relationship, visit my blog @ >>>>  GOODLUCK!
22-10-2009|m|Doesn't matter how it's defined, relationships sprout from attractions. Grow on trust and is nurtured by truth(however you define that is up to you two).
22-10-2009|m|Doesn't matter how it's defined, relationships sprout from attractions. Grow on trust and is nurtured by truth(however you define that is up to you two). @bowolabi, i beg to disagree. Sex is a very IMPORTANT factor! Dont be a fool and come whinnying to Nairalanders tomorrow
22-4-2005||I just must ask this. Why do no-hopers go into politics? (A no-hoper, by the way, is someone or something which is bound to fail).  Every election time in Nigeria, specifically as regards to contesting for the post of the president, you'll see political green horns - and even politicians who know that except a miracle happens they can never win the post they are contesting for - stand for election. They'll pump millions into their campaign. Only God knows where it comes from.  A classic example in Nigeria by the way is Reverend Chris Okotie. He bid for the presidency in 2003 (he didn't even see it wise to start with the legislature), and failed as expected. And now he's on it again. Jim Nwobodo (presidency 2003), Kofoworola Bucknor-Akerele former deputy governor of Lagos (governor 2003), Gemade (presidency 2003) and a host of others are examples too.  These people didn't even need a magic mirror on the wall to tell them they would fail woefully but still went ahead and stood for elections. I'm wondering, did they do it as an ego/CV boosting stunt? So that in future they could be referred to as having one time stood for or contested for so and so post? And if so, is it really wise financially and politically? What do you think?
22-4-2005|m|These people knows what they are doing. They are no fools. They are just wetting the grounds. Soon you will hear that the Asiwaju himself will be contesting for the presidency when it is very clear that he is not going to win, at least by 2007 political zoning arrangement.  There is a saying that goes like this, "Aim for the moon; and if you miss it, at least you will land among the stars". These people know that they will not win the presidential election, but they may end up being considered for a ministerial or ambassadorial post later. At least something will come out of their efforts.
23-4-2005|m|Yeah, Daikim is right.  That's Stunt 101 in politics.
26-4-2005|m|I always smile when I see Revd. Chris Okotie contesting for the post of president. I just smile. I simply don't think he has what it takes. I'm more inclined to vote for someone who has been involved in politics at some level in the last 8 years.
26-4-2005|f|Sorry Seun, I don't quite agree with you on that. We probably do not need people who have been corrupted by the system, someone who is God-fearing and is ready to give selfless service to Nigerians, is what we need! So many people know this, and would have voted for him but for corruption in the form of rigging made it impossible for the " Fresh choice" Pastor Chris Okotie to achieve his ambition. Now he is back again, God told him he would be the next president of this great country .
26-4-2005|m|You want a president who will spend his first three years trying to understand what his job is all about?
03-5-2005|m|The most interesting thing about democracy is the freedom. Its their right to contest and i guess they all want to execise their country given right.  Hey, what would the 2003 elections have been without Okotie's grammer...no fun, or Moji Obasanjo's obstinacy.I guess they add a little fun to such serious matter as politics.It happens the world over.  As an English fan who supports a perpetually losing side in the first division once said "my inspiration is in the losing"  some people don't know how to cut the line and count their losses, they have to go all da way!
03-5-2006|m|Abike Dabiri, a female member of the house of reps, is another lovely contender for future president (2011?)
03-5-2006|m|Guys, what is the role of a President? Is it not administration? As a president, you choose people into your cabinet who are capable of handling the various sectors, and you ensure they've got the backing of the state to achieve the articulated goals. How many economic theories did Obasanjo himself postulated and implemented? I dare say none. If we've seen any improvements in the economy, it is because he chose the right people and he provided the atmosphere for them to work. Our next leader should be such an administrator. He should be fearless and should not have any favors to give to anybody. Whether he is a green horn or not doesn't matter. If you can know the basic rudiments and possess the skills to lead 20,000 people, you will have no problems leading 20 billion. all it takes is appointing more people and delegating authority.
03-5-2006|m|Ngozi Okonjo-iyeala is an administrator. if she contests in 2007 I'll vote for her and campaign for her.

22-4-2005||My dear brother, are you working at Glo now?
22-4-2005|f|this ad is too much!
22-4-2005|m|well, i think this brother is working for glo.  Anyway, the information is very useful and we welcome anybody either working for glo, mtn, vmobile or mtel to be able to answer people's questions.  i like the glo premium but I think I would have preferred it if it had the option of glodirect inclusive.
22-4-2005|m|Eolutosin, I would gladly make you the PR rep for Nairaland! This is a solid ad for Glo Premium. Keep it up!  (Ok, I know you don't actually work for Glo. Just kidding ;-))  Welcome to Nairaland, the Nigerian Forum.
25-4-2005|m|Hm... thanx for all the comments. Well, I use GLO and that gives me the opportunity to really understand the GLO Products. As regds GLO Direct not extended to Premium yet, this would be sorted out soon. Guess, they are already looking into that. Meanwhile, if you have any question on GLO product, u can get back to me. I should be able to render one helping hand or the other. Enjoy
25-4-2005|f|Good enough. Been sort-of drawn to Glo in these last few days especially when I joined the Mobile Nigeria Forum( ) because of their GPRS, MMS ... bla bla, but I just can't make use of two lines now. Might have a rethink ... will just make do with my sister's.
25-4-2005|m|Yeah... GLO gives you so many options . That explains why I opted for the NETWORK in the first instance. Do u know that you can also send free person-to-person MMS from now till 30 September? That's part of their plan to wrestle market share from competition. Anyway, keep on enjoying ya sista own but that will be for a while
23-8-2005||One thing that is common to every Glo subscriber is that one is always ready to flaunt the network anywere, anyhow and any time... GLO WITH PRIDE
23-8-2005|m|wait... if you can flaunt what you have got, who else who do it for u? I use Glo product and that is why I can talk about it. Enjoy
01-9-2010||I think the glo talk more is good but the ZAIN STEP-UP is a lot better. The Zain Step-up is a flat tariff plan. It has a cycle of 30days with a registration fee of #1,500:00. The tariffs are listed below: After loading the #1,500:00 and dialing *200*1# your rates will change to; 36.67Kps for the first 100mins which approximates to #2,200:00 and after which it becomes 25Kps for the next 200mins which approximates to #3,000:00 and after which it becomes 15Kps and this amounts to #9:00 per minute till the expiration of the period. All you need do is spend #6,700:00 on 300mins and start paying #9 per minute till the end of your cycle and you start all over. I think this is better. You can imagine what a @100 zain recharge card would mean after spending #6,700:00. It will mean talking for 11mins plus.
23-4-2005||Hi everybody!  I am very new here but grateful to be associated with people of like minds. I actually like dogs a great deal, but I'm really having problems getting a good breed. My present dog is a mongrel and is called '[I]Razzor[/I]', but I will like to get a 100% Alsatian. I cannot get it abroad, as Nigerians have been involved in so much scam on dog issues.  I will really appreciate it if anybody can link me with somebody with a good breed of Alsatian or Rottweiler. I live in Uyo, Akwa Ibom state and could be reached on 0803 5743750. I can take care of the transpotation to Uyo and the cost of the dog.
23-4-2005|m|Hello Armani,  Welcome to Nairaland. I hope you find what you're looking for soon enough! In the event that  An Alsatian (aka German Shepherd): "Well-bred Alsatians have powerful jaws and strong teeth, can develop a strong sense of loyalty and obedience, and can be trained to attack and release on command."  A Rottweiler ('gentle but dangerous'): "Rottie is not usually a barker: he is a silent watcher who notices everything. Before attacking, he tends to go very still, and there is no warning growl"  If you can't find a breeder through the Internet, I think there are some places in Lagos where Alsatians for sale are displayed along the roads. We should be able to link you with those people.
28-4-2005|m|I conducted some enquiries on your behalf and recieved the following e-mail as a result:  From: gomes adebowale <gomesea@yahoo.com> To: Date: Apr 25, 2005 2:53 PM Subject: Re: Someone needs an German Shepherd!  If you are interested in a German Shephard dog, call me on 08035165413 as I can get the dog for you at a moderate price.  With love from Gomes S.E.A  Please keep us informed about your progress in getting the dog. And when you get the dog, make sure you send us lots of pictures!

23-4-2005|m|Hi,  I am an Australian whose father currently lives in Nigeria and is forever complaining about his slow internet connection and asked me to look into it and what possible options can be done.  Currently he rely's on a connection set up by work in his house (56k dialup which then goes to be queued at the satalite before it finally reaches to the internet in the US) which as you can imagine is quite slow (not uncommon for pages to simply stop loading and timing out)  Anyways my question is what is available for broadband in Eket in Akwa Ibom, I presume satellite is the only real technology available as the phone lines seem too unreliable for xDSL technologys?  Thanks
23-4-2005|m|Hunter, I'll help you look into this issue.  To access the Internet, I use the Internet service provided by a '[I]Fixed Wireless[/i]' phone operator (Multilinks). It's probably much better than a land-line modem but there's nothing you can do about the satellite delay problem.  I get a speed of up to 8 kilobytes/second
23-4-2005|m|even that would be a big improvement over the current setup Wether it is available is probably a big issue though...  His budget would budget would stretch up to about $150 (Australian dollars) or about $130 US (not sure how much niara that is, i think its 15000) a month for a good broadband connection and probably about $30 (Australian dollars) or about $25 US (I think around N3000)  Thanks
23-4-2005|m|I have been trying to use Google to get the information. No luck so far! We will need to contact someone who lives in Uyo.  So what does your dad do in Nigeria?
23-4-2005|m|he works for exonn mobile oil exploration (probably not the most liked people in nigeria) :/
23-4-2005||Seun, I get what you are asking. I get service at home via Stallionet, an ISP in Uyo. It is a wireless connnection, and is really fast compared to what is obtained locally. I suggest you contact victor@ stallionet.com. They also service Eket ...
23-4-2005|m|I'll take a look at that option thanks for the idea  [me=Hidden_Hunter]notices he's downloading at 800KB/s a second teehee [/me]  (I'm spoiled in australia :S )
24-4-2005|m|Armani, thanks for the information.  Their website, obviously is at: www.stallionet.com
24-4-2005|m|yeah i took a look at them (shame ISDN isn't an option, i have a cisco 2611 router that has a nice ISDN card in it )  Internet is very expensive in nigeria it seems I presume Residential - Infinitaz is the 8kb's a second plan?
24-4-2005|m|The bandwidth on Infinitaz is probably shared, so you won't know what you're getting until you test it.
24-4-2005|m|That's always a bit risky though, I'll get him to ask around at work and see if any of the Nigerians that don't live in the company housing estate (and hence don't have Internet provided) use it.
29-4-2005|m|Well, I noticed that one thing nobody mentioned is the issue of cost of the provision.  There are VSAT solutions that he can get for as low as 350thousand Naira and monthly bandwidth for as low as 60thousand naira.  I don't know what in particular he is using it for.Luxiury or WORK??
29-4-2005|m|just a luxury, he might be able to write it off as a company expense though
29-4-2005|m|24 hour access using Multilinks/Starcomms costs 15,000 naira per month . The days when an individual will need to get a VSAT for reliable Internet access are over!
29-4-2005|m|I am not sure your last statement is "general".  So what happens to places like Abuja that doesn't have Starcomm or Multilinks??
29-4-2005|m|Reltel also has such a service. Whatever PTOs are in Abuja could launch similar service anytime. VSAT providers should recognize the next wave and embrace it. You can't insist on charging people 300k for what they can get for 30k, or 60k monthly when another person is ready to offer 15k! You can't do that forever.
14-6-2005||hi, i am victor from stallionet, stallionet can serve you father at eket, all you have to do is get in touch with me by mail victor@stallionet.com, and give me details on your fathers location in eket, then i can send you a startu cost.  thanks
30-8-2005|m|The PTOs that are offering Internet Access are only scamming the licenced ISPs, very soon ISPs will be taking up the case with NCC.  I can only envisage the demsie of Internet Access by these PTOs in the horizon.
27-9-2005|m|what i am using now is multilinks wireless dial-up, but the speed is slow, because i have to download a lot of documents from the web. Is there any boardband connection in Lagos?  thanks!
23-4-2005|m|I am always interested in what people in other countries think of other countries (so it's unbiased) so I was wondering what people think of Australia?  I can say that I like Nigeria because it's a very pretty place and most people are friendly enough (most people are very nice but a few people sometime ruin it for the rest). I say it often to my friends back here at home that I enjoy my trips to Nigeria because of how diverse it is  Potentially Nigeria could make alot of money off tourists if they wanted to but at the moment it's too hard and extremely costly.
24-4-2005|m|Hunter, I love the fact that you like our country! What are the difficulties you face when you come to Nigeria as a tourist?
24-4-2005||I think one of the most treasured experiences about Nigeria is the sense of freedom from all man-made restrictions (what you in a so called "developed " world would call laws). In Nigeria there is so much freedom that you can {urinate} on the streets while a policeman watches out for you. Is it not amazing? This might sound ridiculous, but every time I leave the country and I am coming back it is one thing I miss so much.  Concerning freedom, as per tourist, ... the difficulty is that of an innocent sheep running into a wolf. Nigerians do not like people who are generally ignorant, which is why they are very witty. If you come into Nigeria as a tourist and they realise that you know nothing about your environment, they are bound to use you. So, when coming to Nigeria as a tourist, be sure to have somebody in Nigeria as a guide.
24-4-2005|m|It is quite difficult to get visa's to enter Nigeria (and quite expensive ($160 Australian, N16000)) and a lot of vaccinations are required so that you don't catch things that have been eliminated in Australia (small pox etc)  um Medication is expensive (Normally our government pays for most of our medicine if it is required (most medicines cost less than N1000 or $10 AUD)) but for malaria prevention tablets there not covered (we do not have malaria anymore) and we have to pay about $500 AUD N50000 for enough tablets for a 2 week stay.  Once in Nigeria, main problems are had at the airport in Lagos and the amount of people that need to "inspect" my passport. It would even be somewhat more reassuring if they made customs officers where a uniform or similar because I don't really like handing my passport out to someone in normal clothes saying they are an "official"  I have spent very little time in Lagos but from what time I have spent it seems ok and once at the domestic airport for the short hop over to Eket (customs there is strange, I do not understand why a local airport needs to stamp my passport and check I am not importing anything when I have just been inspected in Lagos)  All of this is a bit daunting first time around but by the second time your used to it so it's not a problem  (One guy in Lagos customs last time I was on the way out was a jerk, he read my passport out wrong and kept saying my middle name and then was abusive to me when he figured out he had been calling out my middle name (after I had tried to say it was my passport))  Anyways, thats most of the difficulties faced that I can think of, but I do enjoy my visits
24-4-2005|m|First of all, I hope this site grows to the point where opinions expressed like this will eventually reach politicians and other people who can make a difference.  I wonder why anti-malaria drugs are expensive in Australia. They are quite cheap here, in the order of 1% of what they cost in your country.
24-4-2005|m|They are expensive because they are non subsidised and not needed for general use (very few countries still require it for travelling now)
24-4-2005|m|(I haven't travelled out before, so I wouldn't know if it's legal to) simply buy one or two packs of anti-malarial drugs here and take them back home for your next visit. Or simply buy the drugs on arrival here ...
24-4-2005|m|Unfortantly you cannot do that for two reasons first being that you have to take them several days before arriving and secondly in Australia we have very strict medicine control to ensure that it is of the highest grade only and i don't think that a product sourced locally would of been tested. (if they think you have a disease they put you in quarantene (basically isolation))
24-4-2005|m|Our malaria drugs work quite well, thank you ().  Anyway, what do you usually look forward to seeing in Nigeria as a tourist?
24-4-2005|m|out in Eket there isn't very mich to do tourist wise but it's just interesting seeing how different everything is.  I hear that there is a few good nature parks near lagos though
25-4-2005|m|Thoughts on other countries? Well, take Senegal for example. There the presidential palace is guarded by 3 policemen (read that last week). Imagine that in Nigeria (there would be a coup every day!)  They don't even speak their own languages (Djollof, Hausa e.t.c) but they speak French (I wouldn't want that to happen here but Seun I expect you would be happy if that happens)
13-6-2005|m|I live in the US and folks urinate on the streets (even on the train) all the time. No biggie.  I dont find nigerians to be a wolf0like as you describe them. Most, especially outside of Lagos, are cool folks
13-6-2005|m|Senegalese speak wolof and fulani, but they love french. My favorite thing about them is thier low aids infection rate, less than 1%
13-6-2005|m|If you are ever back in nigeria, check out Yankari game reserve, or the new Tinapa City being built, the cable car ride and Obudu ranch. These are supposed to be some good areas to visit.  I'd like to check out the australia for the reptiles (croodile farms) and the Barrier reef. I love the way asutralia has 'branded; itself, i.e. once you think of kangaroes, the outback and boomerangs you thin aussie. Nigeria could learn a thing of two from that. Perhaps our unique gorrilas, and special florals could be used to create a brand
13-6-2005|f|Here in Uk, people don't pee on the streets, but they vomit on the streets and er, they eat on the streets while walking. That's freedom cos I know peops in Nigeria can never eat on the streets cos they like posing too much. Imagine walking and eating Mr biggs' rice...no, Nigerians will say they are too much for that. It's good sha.
15-6-2005|m|I dont know if pissing on the streets happens all over the country, but it happens in new york city. NY is a lot like lagos, but with trains
17-6-2005|f|Point of correction,most people don't eat on Nigerian roads not because they are posing, but because they are not sure of what they'll see while eating(k'oju ma r'ibi).....dead body.....smell of tendays old piss.....poo...
17-6-2005|m|Nice one, kemmy!
20-6-2005|m|Australia is a lovely place with lots of deadly creatures but most of the people are nice.But like everwhere else there will always be some wankers who will try spoiling your trip.
20-6-2005|m|I live in the US and folks urinate on the streets (even on the train) all the time. No biggie.  I don't find nigerians to be a wolf0like as you describe them. Most, especially outside of Lagos, are cool folks  Gosh.where in the US cause i'd love to go there and just pee on the street without some 5-0 giving me a ticket

Its not all over the place, but it happens often enough. Im sure some people have gotten tickets for it though
01-7-2005|m|It happens in Jand but if the police catch you then you are in for it! But why would anyone say they like naija for the fact that he can piss on the road without any problem Is that a thing to be proud of? I tire for some people o!  to Hidden Hunter, all those "officials" are probably trying to get you to bribe them and the same with the guy stamping passports in a local airport!  Actually I have very prejudicial views of Australia, for some resaon I always think of it as the land of Skippy that does not welcome blacks, I have always avoided going there on holiday but if you ask me where I got this idea from I honestly could not tell you! Maybe I have watched a neighbours episode or something!!
09-7-2005|m|. America their America . People urinating on the street dem !!. Nigeria has less polluted, fresh air to breathe (* Lagos not included) compared too many developed countries.
09-7-2005|m|Viera, I also see Australia as quite racist. Maybe because of their history with the aborigines or because of John Howard. Those folks just seem to Texan for me.
10-7-2005|m|Racism is everywhere my brother, you would be suprised that asians too are racist. It just in different degrees.
10-7-2005|m|apparently the most racist people on this planet are Japanese!!
10-7-2005|m|Well i did have Japs in my high school. And i find them quiet Nice. infact i have a family friend a Nigerian who is married to a Japanese lady. So i really dont get you there. Perhaps you are reffering back to historical events?
10-7-2005|m|kazey, I am refering to current events. If you read about the culture of japanese in japan you will see.  I have read many accounts of foreigners in Japan and they all agree. They are racist towards both whites and blacks but they look more down on blacks as objects of pity.  I will try and remember the books and articles i read and post them here. I like the Japanese culture and plan to visit Tokyo and hence why I was reading up on the culture.  Those people you know are removed from Japan and obviously not evryone will be the same but I am talking about a foreigner living in Japan.  be right back.
10-7-2005|m|    I am still trying to remember the book but if you do a google search about racism and Japan you will see many articles but the best ones are the ones that are a cultural study and not just a report on one incident.  Gaijin is the Japanese word for all foreigners and it means Babarian
10-7-2005|m|hum well you got your proofs, but as far as i know i am yet to meet a racist japanese. And untill then, my opinion about them is neutral.
10-7-2005|m|Kazey that is the best.  Treat them as they treat you. I would not treat Japanese any other way becuase of what I have read. I still intend to visit Tokyo sometime soon.
